 The correct line at the INFILL location is:

`this.in = new PushbackInputStream(inputStream, buf.capacity());`

This line creates a new `PushbackInputStream` object and assigns it to the `in` field. The `PushbackInputStream` is used to read the data from the input stream, and the `buf.capacity()` method is used to determine the size of the buffer that will be used to store the data.
