 The correct line at the INFILL location is:
```
if (in.peek() != JsonToken.STRING) {
```
This line checks if the next token in the JSON stream is a string, which is expected for the `read` method to work correctly. If the token is not a string, it throws a `JsonParseException` with the message "The date should be a string value".
