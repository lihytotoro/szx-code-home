 The bug is in the `BeanPropertyWriter` constructor, specifically in the `suppressNulls` parameter. The value of `suppressNulls` is determined based on the `inclusion` parameter, which is set to `JsonInclude.Include.NON_DEFAULT`. However, this value is not correctly handled in the `BeanPropertyWriter` constructor.

The correct version of the `BeanPropertyWriter` constructor should be:
```
BeanPropertyWriter bpw = new BeanPropertyWriter(propDef,
        am, _beanDesc.getClassAnnotations(), declaredType,
        ser, typeSer, serializationType,
        (inclusion == JsonInclude.Include.NON_DEFAULT) ? true : false,
        valueToSuppress);
```
This ensures that the `suppressNulls` parameter is set to `true` if the `inclusion` parameter is set to `JsonInclude.Include.NON_DEFAULT`.
