 The correct line at the INFILL location is:
```
return new TypePair(null, null);
```
This line was removed from the code, but it was the original buggy hunk that was causing the issue. The method was returning a `TypePair` with `null` values for both types, which was incorrect. The correct implementation should have returned a `TypePair` with the correct types, based on the input parameters.
