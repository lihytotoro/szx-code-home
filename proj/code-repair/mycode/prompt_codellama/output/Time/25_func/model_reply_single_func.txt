 The buggy function is:
```
public int getOffsetFromLocal(long instantLocal) {
    // get the offset at instantLocal (first estimate)
    final int offsetLocal = getOffset(instantLocal);
    // adjust instantLocal using the estimate and recalc the offset
    final long instantAdjusted = instantLocal - offsetLocal;
    final int offsetAdjusted = getOffset(instantAdjusted);
    // if the offsets differ, we must be near a DST boundary
    if (offsetLocal != offsetAdjusted) {
        // we need to ensure that time is always after the DST gap
        // this happens naturally for positive offsets, but not for negative
        if ((offsetLocal - offsetAdjusted) < 0) {
            // if we just return offsetAdjusted then the time is pushed
            // back before the transition, whereas it should be
            // on or after the transition
            long nextLocal = nextTransition(instantAdjusted);
            long nextAdjusted = nextTransition(instantLocal - offsetAdjusted);
            if (nextLocal != nextAdjusted) {
                return offsetLocal;
            }
        }
    }
    return offsetAdjusted;
}
```
The bug is in the `if` statement where it checks if the offsets differ. If the offsets differ, it assumes that the time is near a DST boundary and adjusts the offset accordingly. However, this assumption is not always correct. For example, if the time is near a DST gap, the offset may be negative, but the adjusted offset may still be positive. In this case, the function will return the adjusted offset, which is incorrect.

To fix the bug, we need to check if the adjusted offset is negative, and if so, return the original offset instead. Here's the corrected function:
```
public int getOffsetFromLocal(long instantLocal) {
    // get the offset at instantLocal (first estimate)
    final int offsetLocal = getOffset(instantLocal);
    // adjust instantLocal using the estimate and recalc the offset
    final long instantAdjusted = instantLocal - offsetLocal;
    final int offsetAdjusted = getOffset(instantAdjusted);
    // if the offsets differ, we must be near a DST boundary
    if (offsetLocal != offsetAdjusted) {
        // we need to ensure that time is always after the DST gap
        // this happens naturally for positive offsets, but not for negative
        if ((offsetLocal - offsetAdjusted) < 0) {
            // if we just return offsetAdjusted then the time is pushed
            // back before the transition, whereas it should be
            // on or after the transition
            long nextLocal = nextTransition(instantAdjusted);
            long nextAdjusted = nextTransition(instantLocal - offsetAdjusted);
            if (nextLocal != nextAdjusted) {
                return offsetLocal;
            }
        } else if (offsetAdjusted < 0) {
            // if the adjusted offset is negative, return the original offset
            return offsetLocal;
        }
    }
    return offsetAdjusted;
}
```
With this correction, the function will return the correct offset for times near a DST boundary.
