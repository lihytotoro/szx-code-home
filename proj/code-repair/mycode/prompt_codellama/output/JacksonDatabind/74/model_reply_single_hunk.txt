 The correct line at the INFILL location is:
```
return super.deserializeTypedFromAny(p, ctxt);
```
This line is called when the parser is pointing to a `START_ARRAY` token, which indicates that the value is a wrapper array. The `super.deserializeTypedFromAny` method is called to deserialize the value as a wrapper array.
