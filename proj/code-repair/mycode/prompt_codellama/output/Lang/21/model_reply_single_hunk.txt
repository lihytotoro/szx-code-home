 The correct line at the INFILL location should be:

cal1.get(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY) == cal2.get(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY)

This is because the method `get(Calendar.HOUR)` returns the hour in the 12-hour clock format, while the method `get(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY)` returns the hour in the 24-hour clock format. In this case, the test is checking that the hour of the two `Calendar` objects is the same, and the correct method to use is `get(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY)`.
