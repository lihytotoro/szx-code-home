 The correct line at the INFILL location is:
```
ignored = ignorals.getIgnored();
```
This line is used to get the list of ignored properties from the `JsonIgnoreProperties.Value` object. However, the `getIgnored()` method returns `null` instead of an empty list, which causes the `ignored` variable to be `null` instead of an empty list.

To fix this bug, you can change the line to:
```
ignored = ignorals.getIgnored() != null ? ignorals.getIgnored() : Collections.emptySet();
```
This ensures that the `ignored` variable is always initialized to an empty list, even if the `getIgnored()` method returns `null`.
