 The bug in the code is that it does not check if the `in` object is null before calling the `getNextEntry()` method. This can cause a `NullPointerException` if the `in` object is null.

Here is the corrected version of the `close()` method:
```
public void close() throws IOException {
    if (!this.closed) {
        if (in != null) {
            in.close();
        }
        this.closed = true;
    }
}
```
This version checks if the `in` object is null before calling the `close()` method, which prevents the `NullPointerException` from occurring.
