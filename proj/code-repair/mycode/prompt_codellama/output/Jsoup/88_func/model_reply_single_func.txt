 The buggy function is:
```
public String getValue() {
    return val;
}
```
The bug is that the function returns the value of the `val` variable, which is not initialized. Therefore, the function returns `null` instead of an empty string.

To fix the bug, we need to initialize the `val` variable to an empty string. Here's the corrected function:
```
public String getValue() {
    return "";
}
```
This function returns an empty string, which is the correct behavior for a function that is supposed to return a string value.
