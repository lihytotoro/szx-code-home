 The bug in the code is that it is modifying the `calendar` object instead of creating a new one. This means that the `calendar` object is being modified and the `applyRules` method is using the modified object, which is not what we want.

To fix the bug, we need to create a new `Calendar` object and use that instead of the `calendar` object. Here is the corrected code:
```
public StringBuffer format(Calendar calendar, StringBuffer buf) {
    if (mTimeZoneForced) {
        Calendar newCalendar = (Calendar) calendar.clone();
        newCalendar.setTimeZone(mTimeZone);
        return applyRules(newCalendar, buf);
    } else {
        return applyRules(calendar, buf);
    }
}
```
This code creates a new `Calendar` object and sets the time zone on that object, rather than modifying the `calendar` object. This ensures that the `applyRules` method is using a new `Calendar` object that has the correct time zone, and that the `calendar` object is not modified.
