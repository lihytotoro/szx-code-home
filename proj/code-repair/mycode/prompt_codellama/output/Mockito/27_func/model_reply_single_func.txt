 The bug in the code is that the `MockHandler` object is not properly initialized. The `MockHandler` constructor takes a `MockHandlerInterface` object as a parameter, but the `getMockHandler` method returns a `MockHandler` object, which is not a subclass of `MockHandlerInterface`.

Here is the corrected version of the code:
```
public <T> void resetMock(T mock) {
    MockHandlerInterface<T> oldMockHandler = getMockHandler(mock);
    MockHandler<T> newMockHandler = new MockHandler<T>(oldMockHandler);
    MethodInterceptorFilter newFilter = new MethodInterceptorFilter(newMockHandler, (MockSettingsImpl) org.mockito.Mockito.withSettings().defaultAnswer(org.mockito.Mockito.RETURNS_DEFAULTS));
    ((Factory) mock).setCallback(0, newFilter);
}
```
In this version, the `getMockHandler` method returns a `MockHandlerInterface` object, which is then passed to the `MockHandler` constructor. This ensures that the `MockHandler` object is properly initialized and can be used as a `MockHandlerInterface` object.
