 The bug is in the `anythingElse` function, which is called when the character is not a letter, not a whitespace character, and not a `/` or `>` character. The function should handle the case where the character is a quote (`'`) or a double quote (`"`), but it does not.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```
void anythingElse(Tokeniser t, CharacterReader r) {
    if (r.matchesAny('"', '\'')) {
        t.tagPending.appendTagName(r.consumeLetterSequence().toLowerCase());
        t.dataBuffer.append(r.consumeLetterSequence());
        r.advance();
        return;
    }
    // ...
}
```
This version of the function checks if the character is a quote or a double quote, and if so, it consumes the sequence of letters that follows and appends it to the `tagPending` and `dataBuffer` buffers. This fixes the bug and allows the test to pass.
