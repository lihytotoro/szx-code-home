 The bug is in the `getCurrentStream()` method, which is supposed to return the current input stream for reading the 7z file. However, the method is not handling the case where the `deferredBlockStreams` list is empty, which means there are no more input streams to read from.

The method should throw an `IllegalStateException` in this case, as there is no current 7z entry to read. The correct version of the method should be:
```
private InputStream getCurrentStream() throws IOException {
    if (deferredBlockStreams.isEmpty()) {
        throw new IllegalStateException("No current 7z entry (call getNextEntry() first).");
    }

    return deferredBlockStreams.get(0);
}
```
This version of the method checks if the `deferredBlockStreams` list is empty, and if so, throws an `IllegalStateException` with the appropriate message. If the list is not empty, it returns the first input stream in the list.
