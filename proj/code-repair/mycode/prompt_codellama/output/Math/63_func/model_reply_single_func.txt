 The buggy function is:
```
public static boolean equals(double x, double y) {
    return (Double.isNaN(x) && Double.isNaN(y)) || x == y;
}
```
The correct version of the function should be:
```
public static boolean equals(double x, double y) {
    return (Double.isNaN(x) && Double.isNaN(y)) || (x == y);
}
```
The bug is that the function is not handling the case where both `x` and `y` are `Double.NaN`. The correct version of the function should use the `||` operator instead of the `&&` operator to check if either `x` or `y` is `Double.NaN`.
