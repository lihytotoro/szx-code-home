 The bug in the code is in the `while` loop. The `text` variable is being modified in the loop, but the `pos` variable is not being updated accordingly. This means that the `findWrapPos` method is being called with the same `text` parameter each time, which is causing the `pos` variable to always return -1.

To fix the bug, the `pos` variable should be updated in the loop, like this:
```
while (true)
{
    text = padding + text.substring(pos).trim();
    pos = findWrapPos(text, width, nextLineTabStop);

    if (pos == -1)
    {
        sb.append(text);

        return sb;
    }

    sb.append(rtrim(text.substring(0, pos))).append(defaultNewLine);
}
```
This will ensure that the `pos` variable is updated correctly, and the `findWrapPos` method is called with the correct `text` parameter each time.
