 The correct line at the INFILL location should be:
```
|| TreeNode.class.isAssignableFrom(t.getRawClass()));
```
This is because the `TreeNode` class is a subtype of `JsonNode`, and the `isAssignableFrom` method checks if the class is a subtype of the given class. In this case, the `TreeNode` class is a subtype of `JsonNode`, so the method returns `true`.
