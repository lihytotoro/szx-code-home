 The correct line at the INFILL location should be:
```
return NodeUtil.isFunctionExpression(n);
```
This is the correct implementation of the `isReduceableFunctionExpression` method, which checks if a given node is a function expression. The method is used in the `reduceFunctionExpressions` method to determine if a function expression can be reduced.
