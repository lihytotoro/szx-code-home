 The buggy function is:
```
public long readBits(final int count) throws IOException {
    if (count < 0 || count > MAXIMUM_CACHE_SIZE) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("count must not be negative or greater than " + MAXIMUM_CACHE_SIZE);
    }
    while (bitsCachedSize < count) {
        final long nextByte = in.read();
        if (nextByte < 0) {
            return nextByte;
        }
        if (byteOrder == ByteOrder.LITTLE_ENDIAN) {
            bitsCached |= (nextByte << bitsCachedSize);
        } else {
            bitsCached <<= 8;
            bitsCached |= nextByte;
        }
        bitsCachedSize += 8;
    }
    // bitsCachedSize >= 57 and left-shifting it 8 bits would cause an overflow
    
    final long bitsOut;
    if (byteOrder == ByteOrder.LITTLE_ENDIAN) {
        bitsOut = (bitsCached & MASKS[count]);
        bitsCached >>>= count;
    } else {
        bitsOut = (bitsCached >> (bitsCachedSize - count)) & MASKS[count];
    }
    bitsCachedSize -= count;
    return bitsOut;
}
```
The bug is in the line `bitsCached <<= 8;`, which should be `bitsCached <<= 7;` instead. This is because `bitsCachedSize` is initially set to 57, and left-shifting it by 8 bits would cause an overflow. By changing the line to `bitsCached <<= 7;`, the bug is fixed and the function works correctly.
