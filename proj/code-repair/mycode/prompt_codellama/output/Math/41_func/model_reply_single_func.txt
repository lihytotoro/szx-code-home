 The bug in the function is that it is not correctly handling the case where the length of the array segment is 1. In this case, the function should return 0.0, but it is returning Double.NaN instead.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```
public double evaluate(final double[] values, final double[] weights,
                       final double mean, final int begin, final int length) {

    double var = Double.NaN;

    if (test(values, weights, begin, length)) {
        if (length == 1) {
            var = 0.0;
        } else if (length > 1) {
            double accum = 0.0;
            double dev = 0.0;
            double accum2 = 0.0;
            for (int i = begin; i < begin + length; i++) {
                dev = values[i] - mean;
                accum += weights[i] * (dev * dev);
                accum2 += weights[i] * dev;
            }

            double sumWts = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < weights.length; i++) {
                sumWts += weights[i];
            }

            if (isBiasCorrected) {
                var = (accum - (accum2 * accum2 / sumWts)) / (sumWts - 1.0);
            } else {
                var = (accum - (accum2 * accum2 / sumWts)) / sumWts;
            }
        }
    }
    return var;
}
```
In the corrected version, the `if (length == 1)` case is handled correctly by returning 0.0.
