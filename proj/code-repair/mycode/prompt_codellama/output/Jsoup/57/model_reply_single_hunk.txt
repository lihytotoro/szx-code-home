 The correct line at the INFILL location should be:

attributes.remove(attrKey);

This line removes the attribute with the specified key from the map, which is the correct behavior for the method. The original buggy hunk, which was removed, was attempting to remove the attribute with the specified key from the map, but it was not doing so correctly. The correct line at the INFILL location is the only line that correctly removes the attribute with the specified key from the map.
