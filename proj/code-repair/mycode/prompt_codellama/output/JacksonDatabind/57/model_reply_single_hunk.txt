 The correct line at the INFILL location should be:
```
return _bindAndReadValues(_considerFilter(_parserFactory.createParser(src), true));
```
This is the corrected version of the method that fixes the bug. The `true` argument to `_considerFilter` indicates that the parser should be filtered to remove any invalid UTF-32 characters.
