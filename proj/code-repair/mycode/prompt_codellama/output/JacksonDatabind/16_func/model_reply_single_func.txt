 The bug in the code is that it is using the `equals` method to compare the previous annotation with the new one, but it should be using the `==` operator to compare the references.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```
protected final boolean _add(Annotation ann) {
    if (_annotations == null) {
        _annotations = new HashMap<Class<? extends Annotation>,Annotation>();
    }
    Annotation previous = _annotations.put(ann.annotationType(), ann);
    return (previous != null) && (previous == ann);
}
```
This will fix the bug and the test will pass.
