 The bug is caused by the fact that the `ChartFactory.createScatterPlot()` method returns a `JFreeChart` object, but the `getDataRange()` method is expecting an `XYDataset` object.

To fix the bug, you can modify the `getDataRange()` method to accept a `JFreeChart` object instead of an `XYDataset` object. Here's the modified code:
```java
public Range getDataRange(JFreeChart chart) {
    // ...
}
```
Then, you can call the `getDataRange()` method with a `JFreeChart` object instead of an `XYDataset` object:
```java
Range range = getDataRange(chart);
```
This should fix the bug and allow the test to pass.
