 The correct line at the INFILL location should be:
```
found = key.equalsIgnoreCase(prop.getName());
```
This is because the `key` variable is a String that represents the name of the property to be removed, and the `prop` variable is a `SettableBeanProperty` object that represents the property in the `props` list. The `getName()` method of the `SettableBeanProperty` class returns the name of the property, and the `equalsIgnoreCase()` method is used to compare the `key` variable to the name of the property in a case-insensitive manner.
