 The buggy function is:
```
public CSVPrinter(final Appendable out, final CSVFormat format) throws IOException {
    Assertions.notNull(out, "out");
    Assertions.notNull(format, "format");

    this.out = out;
    this.format = format;
    this.format.validate();
    // TODO: Is it a good idea to do this here instead of on the first call to a print method?
    // It seems a pain to have to track whether the header has already been printed or not.
}
```
The bug is in the comment above the line where the header is printed. It should be printed on the first call to a print method, not in the constructor.

The corrected function should be:
```
public CSVPrinter(final Appendable out, final CSVFormat format) throws IOException {
    Assertions.notNull(out, "out");
    Assertions.notNull(format, "format");

    this.out = out;
    this.format = format;
    this.format.validate();
}

public void printHeader() throws IOException {
    this.out.append(this.format.getHeader());
}
```
In the corrected function, the header is printed in a separate method called `printHeader`. This method is called on the first call to a print method, and it prints the header using the `format.getHeader()` method.

The corrected function should be used in place of the buggy function in the code.
