 The bug is in the line `super.serializeValue(jgen, null);`. The `serializeValue` method is called with a null value, which is not handled correctly.

The correct version of the function should be:
```
protected void _serializeXmlNull(JsonGenerator jgen) throws IOException
{
    // 14-Nov-2016, tatu: As per [dataformat-xml#213], we may have explicitly
    //    configured root name...
    if (jgen instanceof ToXmlGenerator) {
        _initWithRootName((ToXmlGenerator) jgen, ROOT_NAME_FOR_NULL);
    }
    super.serializeValue(jgen, "null");
}
```
In this version, the `serializeValue` method is called with the string "null" instead of a null value. This is because the `serializeValue` method expects a non-null value, and passing a null value will cause the method to fail. By passing the string "null", the method is able to handle the null value correctly.
