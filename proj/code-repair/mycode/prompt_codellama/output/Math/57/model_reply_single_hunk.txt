 The correct line at the INFILL location is:

int sum = 0;

The bug was that the variable "sum" was not initialized before it was used in the loop. The correct code should be:

int sum = 0;
for (int i = 0; i < pointSet.size(); i++) {
    final T p = pointSet.get(i);
    final Cluster<T> nearest = getNearestCluster(resultSet, p);
    final double d = p.distanceFrom(nearest.getCenter());
    sum += d * d;
    dx2[i] = sum;
}
