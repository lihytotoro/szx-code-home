 The buggy hunk is in the `parse` method, and the INFILL location is in the `if (date.length() <= offset)` block.

The bug is that the method is not handling the case where the input string has a time zone offset but no minutes, such as `+00`. The method is expecting the time zone offset to be in the format `+00:00`, but it is not.

To fix the bug, the method should be updated to handle the case where the time zone offset has no minutes, such as:
```
if (timezoneIndicator == 'Z') {
    timezone = TIMEZONE_UTC;
    offset += 1;
} else if (timezoneIndicator == '+' || timezoneIndicator == '-') {
    String timezoneOffset = date.substring(offset);

    // When timezone has no minutes, we should append it, valid timezones are, for example: +00:00, +0000 and +00
    if (timezoneOffset.length() == 2) {
        timezoneOffset += ":00";
    }

    // ...
}
```
This will ensure that the method handles the case where the time zone offset has no minutes correctly.
