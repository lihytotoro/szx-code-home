 The correct line at the INFILL location is:

if (Double.isNaN(value) || Double.isInfinite(value)) {

This line checks if the value is not a number (NaN) or infinite, which is not allowed in JSON. If the value is not a number or infinite, an IllegalArgumentException is thrown with a message indicating that the value must be finite.
