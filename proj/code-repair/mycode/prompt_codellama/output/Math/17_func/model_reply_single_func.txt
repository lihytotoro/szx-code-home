 The buggy function is:
```
public Dfp multiply(final int x) {
    return multiplyFast(x);
}
```
The correct version of the function should be:
```
public Dfp multiply(final int x) {
    return multiplySlow(x);
}
```
The bug is that the function is calling `multiplyFast` instead of `multiplySlow`. `multiplyFast` is a private method that is not intended to be called from outside the class, so it is not a valid implementation of the `multiply` method.

The correct implementation of the `multiply` method should be:
```
public Dfp multiply(final int x) {
    return multiplySlow(x);
}
```
This implementation calls the `multiplySlow` method, which is a public method that is intended to be called from outside the class. This ensures that the `multiply` method is correctly implemented and can be used in the test.
