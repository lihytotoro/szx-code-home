 The correct line at the INFILL location is:
```
if (_resultString != null) {
    return (_resultArray = _resultString.toCharArray());
}
```
This line is added to handle the case where the `getTextBuffer()` method is called when the `_resultString` field is not null, but the `_resultArray` field is null. In this case, the method needs to create a new array from the `_resultString` field and return it.
