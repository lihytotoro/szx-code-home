 The bug is caused by the fact that the `mixIns` parameter is not being used correctly. The function is adding the mix-in methods to the `mixIns` list, but it is not actually using the `mixIns` list to find the methods to augment.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```
protected void _addMethodMixIns(Class<?> targetClass, AnnotatedMethodMap methods,
        Class<?> mixInCls, AnnotatedMethodMap mixIns)
{
    List<Class<?>> parents = new ArrayList<Class<?>>();
    parents.add(mixInCls);
    ClassUtil.findSuperTypes(mixInCls, targetClass, parents);
    for (Class<?> mixin : parents) {
        for (Method m : mixin.getDeclaredMethods()) {
            if (!_isIncludableMemberMethod(m)) {
                continue;
            }
            AnnotatedMethod am = methods.find(m);
            if (am != null) {
                _addMixUnders(m, am);
            } else {
                mixIns.add(_constructMethod(m));
            }
        }
    }
}
```
In this version, the function first checks if there is an existing method to augment (using the `methods` parameter) and if so, it adds the mix-in method to the `mixIns` list. If there is no existing method to augment, the function adds the mix-in method to the `mixIns` list.

The corrected version of the function should fix the bug and allow the test to pass.
