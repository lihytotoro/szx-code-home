 The bug in the code is that it is not handling relative URLs with a query string correctly. The function `absUrl` is supposed to make a URL absolute by combining it with a base URL, but it is not handling the case where the relative URL has a query string.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```
public String absUrl(String attributeKey) {
    Validate.notEmpty(attributeKey);

    String relUrl = attr(attributeKey);
    if (!hasAttr(attributeKey)) {
        return ""; // nothing to make absolute with
    } else {
        URL base;
        try {
            base = new URL(baseUri);
        } catch (MalformedURLException e) {
            return "";
        }
        // workaround: java resolves '//path/file + ?foo' to '//path/?foo', not '//path/file?foo' as desired
        URL abs = new URL(base, relUrl);
        return abs.toExternalForm();
    }
}
```
In the corrected version, we first try to create a `URL` object from the base URI. If this fails, we return an empty string. Otherwise, we create a `URL` object from the relative URL and combine it with the base URL using the `URL` constructor. We then return the absolute URL as a string using the `toExternalForm()` method.

This corrected version should pass the test `absHandlesRelativeQuery` correctly.
