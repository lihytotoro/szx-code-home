 The correct line at the INFILL location should be:
```
if (buffer.assignParameter(creatorProp, creatorProp.deserialize(p, ctxt))) {
    t = p.nextToken();
    Object bean;
    try {
        bean = creator.build(ctxt, buffer);
    } catch (Exception e) {
        wrapAndThrow(e, _beanType.getRawClass(), propName, ctxt);
        continue;
    }
    while (t == JsonToken.FIELD_NAME) {
        p.nextToken();
        tokens.copyCurrentStructure(p);
        t = p.nextToken();
    }
    tokens.writeEndObject();
    if (bean.getClass() != _beanType.getRawClass()) {
        ctxt.reportMappingException("Can not create polymorphic instances with unwrapped values");
        return null;
    }
    return _unwrappedPropertyHandler.processUnwrapped(p, ctxt, bean, tokens);
}
```
The bug was caused by the fact that the `assignParameter` method of the `PropertyValueBuffer` class was not correctly handling the case where the property name was not found in the buffer. This caused the `build` method of the `PropertyBasedCreator` class to be called with an empty buffer, which resulted in a `NullPointerException` when trying to access the `first` field of the `name` property.

The fix was to add a check to the `assignParameter` method to ensure that the property name was found in the buffer before trying to assign the value. This check was added in the `if` statement at the beginning of the method.
