 The bug in the code is that the `EigenDecomposition` class is not being properly disposed of after it is no longer needed. This can cause a memory leak, which can lead to an `OutOfMemoryError` exception.

To fix the bug, you can add a `try-finally` block to ensure that the `EigenDecomposition` object is properly disposed of, even if an exception is thrown. Here is the corrected code:
```
private RealMatrix squareRoot(RealMatrix m) {
    try {
        final EigenDecomposition dec = new EigenDecomposition(m);
        return dec.getSquareRoot();
    } finally {
        dec.dispose();
    }
}
```
This code ensures that the `EigenDecomposition` object is properly disposed of, even if an exception is thrown.
