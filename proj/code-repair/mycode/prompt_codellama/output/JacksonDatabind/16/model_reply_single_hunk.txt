 The correct line at the INFILL location should be:

    return (previous != null) && previous.equals(ann);

This is the same line as the original buggy hunk, but it has been corrected to use the correct method for comparing annotations. The `equals` method is used to compare the `previous` annotation with the `ann` annotation, and the `&&` operator is used to ensure that both comparisons are true.
