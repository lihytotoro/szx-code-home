 The bug in the code is that it is not properly cloning the `TimeSeriesDataItem` objects when creating the copy of the `TimeSeries`. The `clone()` method is being called on the `TimeSeriesDataItem` objects, but it is not actually cloning the objects. Instead, it is creating a new `TimeSeriesDataItem` object with the same values as the original object.

Here is the corrected version of the `createCopy` method:
```
public TimeSeries createCopy(int start, int end)
        throws CloneNotSupportedException {
    if (start < 0) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Requires start >= 0.");
    }
    if (end < start) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Requires start <= end.");
    }
    TimeSeries copy = (TimeSeries) super.clone();
    copy.data = new java.util.ArrayList();
    if (this.data.size() > 0) {
        for (int index = start; index <= end; index++) {
            TimeSeriesDataItem item
                    = (TimeSeriesDataItem) this.data.get(index);
            TimeSeriesDataItem clone = (TimeSeriesDataItem) item.clone();
            try {
                copy.add(clone);
            }
            catch (SeriesException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
    }
    return copy;
}
```
In this version, the `clone()` method is being called on the `TimeSeriesDataItem` objects, which properly clones the objects and creates a new copy of them. This ensures that the copy of the `TimeSeries` has its own independent data, rather than sharing the same data as the original `TimeSeries`.
