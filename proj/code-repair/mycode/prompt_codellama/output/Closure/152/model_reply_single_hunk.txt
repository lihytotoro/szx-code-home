 The correct line at the INFILL location is:
```
typeOfThis = (ObjectType) safeResolve(typeOfThis, t, scope);
```
This line is casting the result of the `safeResolve` method to an `ObjectType`, but the method is returning a `StringType` instead. This is causing the `ClassCastException` to be thrown.
