 The correct line at the INFILL location is:
```
if (!("yes".equalsIgnoreCase(value)
        || "true".equalsIgnoreCase(value)
        || "1".equalsIgnoreCase(value)))
{
    // if the value is not yes, true or 1 then don't add the
    // option to the CommandLine
    break;
}
```
This is because the `break` statement is not inside the `if` statement, and it is not clear what the intention of the code is. The `break` statement is used to exit a loop, but it is not clear what loop it should exit.

The corrected code should be:
```
if (!("yes".equalsIgnoreCase(value)
        || "true".equalsIgnoreCase(value)
        || "1".equalsIgnoreCase(value)))
{
    // if the value is not yes, true or 1 then don't add the
    // option to the CommandLine
    continue;
}
```
This will continue to the next iteration of the loop, rather than exiting the loop.
