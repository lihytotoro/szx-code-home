 The correct line at the INFILL location is:
```
return deferredBlockStreams.get(0);
```
This line is returning the first element of the `deferredBlockStreams` list, which is the current input stream. The buggy hunk was removing the first element of the list, which was causing the `getCurrentStream()` method to return an empty stream.
