 The correct line at the INFILL location is:

    addValue((Comparable<?>) v);

This line casts the `Object` to `Comparable<?>`, which is the type of the `addValue` method. The cast is necessary because the `addValue` method is defined to take a `Comparable<?>` as a parameter, and the `Object` class does not implement the `Comparable` interface. By casting the `Object` to `Comparable<?>`, the code ensures that the `addValue` method is called with a parameter that is a `Comparable`, which is the type that the method is expecting.
