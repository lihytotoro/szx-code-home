 The correct line at the INFILL location should be:
```
return FastMath.pow(2 * FastMath.PI, -dim / 2) *
```
This line calculates the density of the univariate distribution using the formula:
```
density = (2 * PI)^(-dim / 2) * exponentTerm
```
where `exponentTerm` is a function of the input values `vals`. The buggy hunk was removed because it was incorrect and caused the test to fail.
