 The bug in the code is in the line `if (x < 0 && prev == '-') {`. This condition is always false, because `prev` is always equal to the last character of the string, which is not a hyphen.

To fix the bug, you need to change the condition to `if (x < 0 && prev == '-' && prev != ' ')` to check if the previous character is a hyphen and not a space.

Here is the corrected code:
```
void addNumber(double x) {
  // This is not pretty printing. This is to prevent misparsing of x- -4 as
  // x--4 (which is a syntax error).
  char prev = getLastChar();
  if (x < 0 && prev == '-' && prev != ' ') {
    add(" ");
  }

  if ((long) x == x) {
    long value = (long) x;
    long mantissa = value;
    int exp = 0;
    if (Math.abs(x) >= 100) {
      while (mantissa / 10 * Math.pow(10, exp + 1) == value) {
        mantissa /= 10;
        exp++;
      }
    }
    if (exp > 2) {
      add(Long.toString(mantissa) + "E" + Integer.toString(exp));
    } else {
      add(Long.toString(value));
    }
  } else {
    add(String.valueOf(x));
  }

}
```
This code should now pass the test `testIssue582` with the following test error:
```
junit.framework.ComparisonFailure: expected:<var x=-0.0> but was:<var x=-0.0>
```
