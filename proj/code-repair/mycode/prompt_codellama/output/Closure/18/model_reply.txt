 The correct line should be:

if (options.dependencyOptions.needsManagement() && options.closurePass && !options.processCommonJSModules) {

This is because the test is expecting the code to be sorted in a specific order, and the buggy line was causing the code to be sorted incorrectly. The corrected line ensures that the code is sorted correctly, and the test passes.
