 The correct line at the INFILL location is:
```
if ("AbstractPointcutAdvisor".equals(name)
        || "AbstractApplicationContext".equals(name)) {
    break main_check;
}
```
This line checks if the class name is "AbstractPointcutAdvisor" or "AbstractApplicationContext", and if so, breaks out of the main_check loop. This is necessary because these classes are not allowed to be deserialized, and the code needs to prevent them from being deserialized.
