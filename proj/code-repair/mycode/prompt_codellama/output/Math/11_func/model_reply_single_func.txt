 The bug in the function is that it is using the `getDimension()` method to get the number of dimensions of the distribution, but it is not taking into account the fact that the `vals` array may have more than one element.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```
public double density(final double[] vals) throws DimensionMismatchException {
    final int dim = vals.length;
    if (dim != getDimension()) {
        throw new DimensionMismatchException(dim, getDimension());
    }

    return FastMath.pow(2 * FastMath.PI, -dim / 2) *
        FastMath.pow(covarianceMatrixDeterminant, -0.5) *
        getExponentTerm(vals);
}
```
In this version, the `dim` variable is set to the length of the `vals` array, which is the number of dimensions of the distribution. This ensures that the function will work correctly even if the `vals` array has more than one element.
