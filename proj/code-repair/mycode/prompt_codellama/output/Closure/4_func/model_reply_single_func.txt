 The buggy function is:
```
JSType resolveInternal(ErrorReporter t, StaticScope<JSType> enclosing) {
  // TODO(user): Investigate whether it is really necessary to keep two
  // different mechanisms for resolving named types, and if so, which order
  // makes more sense. Now, resolution via registry is first in order to
  // avoid triggering the warnings built into the resolution via properties.
  boolean resolved = resolveViaRegistry(t, enclosing);
  if (detectImplicitPrototypeCycle()) {
    handleTypeCycle(t);
  }

  if (resolved) {
    super.resolveInternal(t, enclosing);
    finishPropertyContinuations();
    return registry.isLastGeneration() ?
        getReferencedType() : this;
  }

  resolveViaProperties(t, enclosing);
  if (detectImplicitPrototypeCycle()) {
    handleTypeCycle(t);
  }

  super.resolveInternal(t, enclosing);
  if (isResolved()) {
    finishPropertyContinuations();
  }
  return registry.isLastGeneration() ?
      getReferencedType() : this;
}
```
The bug is in the `resolveViaProperties` method, which is called twice in the function. The first time it is called, it resolves the type using the properties of the type, but it does not check for cycles. The second time it is called, it checks for cycles and handles them, but it does not resolve the type using the properties.

The correct version of the function should be:
```
JSType resolveInternal(ErrorReporter t, StaticScope<JSType> enclosing) {
  // TODO(user): Investigate whether it is really necessary to keep two
  // different mechanisms for resolving named types, and if so, which order
  // makes more sense. Now, resolution via registry is first in order to
  // avoid triggering the warnings built into the resolution via properties.
  boolean resolved = resolveViaRegistry(t, enclosing);
  if (detectImplicitPrototypeCycle()) {
    handleTypeCycle(t);
  }

  if (resolved) {
    super.resolveInternal(t, enclosing);
    finishPropertyContinuations();
    return registry.isLastGeneration() ?
        getReferencedType() : this;
  }

  resolveViaProperties(t, enclosing);
  if (detectImplicitPrototypeCycle()) {
    handleTypeCycle(t);
  }

  resolved = resolveViaProperties(t, enclosing);
  if (resolved) {
    super.resolveInternal(t, enclosing);
    finishPropertyContinuations();
    return registry.isLastGeneration() ?
        getReferencedType() : this;
  }

  super.resolveInternal(t, enclosing);
  if (isResolved()) {
    finishPropertyContinuations();
  }
  return registry.isLastGeneration() ?
      getReferencedType() : this;
}
```
In the corrected version, the `resolveViaProperties` method is called twice, but the second time it is called, it checks for cycles and handles them, and it also resolves the type using the properties. This fixes the bug and makes the function work correctly.
