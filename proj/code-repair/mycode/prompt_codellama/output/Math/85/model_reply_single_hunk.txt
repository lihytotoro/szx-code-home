 The correct line at the INFILL location should be:

if (fa * fb <= 0.0) {

This is because the original line was checking for a positive product of fa and fb, which would always be true since the product of two numbers is always positive or zero. The corrected line checks for a negative product of fa and fb, which would indicate that the function is not monotonically increasing or decreasing, and therefore the bracketing process has failed.
