 The buggy function is:
```
private void recordAssignment(NodeTraversal t, Node n, Node recordNode) {
  Node nameNode = n.getFirstChild();
  Node parent = n.getParent();
  NameInformation ns = createNameInformation(t, nameNode);
  if (ns != null) {
    if (parent.isFor() && !NodeUtil.isForIn(parent)) {
      // Patch for assignments that appear in the init,
      // condition or iteration part of a FOR loop.  Without
      // this change, all 3 of those parts try to claim the for
      // loop as their dependency scope.  The last assignment in
      // those three fields wins, which can result in incorrect
      // reference edges between referenced and assigned variables.
      //
      // TODO(user) revisit the dependency scope calculation
      // logic.
      if (parent.getFirstChild().getNext() != n) {
        recordDepScope(recordNode, ns);
      } else {
        recordDepScope(nameNode, ns);
      }
    } else {
      // The rhs of the assignment is the caller, so it's used by the
      // context. Don't associate it w/ the lhs.
      // FYI: this fixes only the specific case where the assignment is the
      // caller expression, but it could be nested deeper in the caller and
      // we would still get a bug.
      // See testAssignWithCall2 for an example of this.
      recordDepScope(recordNode, ns);
    }
  }
}
```
The bug is in the `else` block, where the `recordDepScope` method is called with `recordNode` as the first argument, instead of `nameNode`. This means that the dependency scope of the assignment is not correctly calculated, and the reference edges between the referenced and assigned variables are not correctly set.

The corrected function should be:
```
private void recordAssignment(NodeTraversal t, Node n, Node recordNode) {
  Node nameNode = n.getFirstChild();
  Node parent = n.getParent();
  NameInformation ns = createNameInformation(t, nameNode);
  if (ns != null) {
    if (parent.isFor() && !NodeUtil.isForIn(parent)) {
      // Patch for assignments that appear in the init,
      // condition or iteration part of a FOR loop.  Without
      // this change, all 3 of those parts try to claim the for
      // loop as their dependency scope.  The last assignment in
      // those three fields wins, which can result in incorrect
      // reference edges between referenced and assigned variables.
      //
      // TODO(user) revisit the dependency scope calculation
      // logic.
      if (parent.getFirstChild().getNext() != n) {
        recordDepScope(recordNode, ns);
      } else {
        recordDepScope(nameNode, ns);
      }
    } else {
      // The rhs of the assignment is the caller, so it's used by the
      // context. Don't associate it w/ the lhs.
      // FYI: this fixes only the specific case where the assignment is the
      // caller expression, but it could be nested deeper in the caller and
      // we would still get a bug.
      // See testAssignWithCall2 for an example of this.
      recordDepScope(nameNode, ns);
    }
  }
}
```
This corrected function correctly sets the dependency scope of the assignment, and the reference edges between the referenced and assigned variables are correctly set.
