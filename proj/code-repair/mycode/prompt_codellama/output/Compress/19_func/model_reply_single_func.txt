 The buggy function is trying to read the length of the central directory data from the `rawCentralDirectoryData` field, but it is not taking into account the possibility that there may be excess data in the extra field. The `expectedLength` variable is calculated based on the presence of certain flags, but it does not account for the possibility that there may be additional data in the extra field.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```
public void reparseCentralDirectoryData(boolean hasUncompressedSize,
                                        boolean hasCompressedSize,
                                        boolean hasRelativeHeaderOffset,
                                        boolean hasDiskStart)
    throws ZipException {
    if (rawCentralDirectoryData != null) {
        int expectedLength = (hasUncompressedSize ? DWORD : 0)
            + (hasCompressedSize ? DWORD : 0)
            + (hasRelativeHeaderOffset ? DWORD : 0)
            + (hasDiskStart ? WORD : 0);
        if (rawCentralDirectoryData.length < expectedLength) {
            throw new ZipException("central directory zip64 extended"
                                   + " information extra field's length"
                                   + " doesn't match central directory"
                                   + " data.  Expected length "
                                   + expectedLength + " but is "
                                   + rawCentralDirectoryData.length);
        }
        int offset = 0;
        if (hasUncompressedSize) {
            size = new ZipEightByteInteger(rawCentralDirectoryData, offset);
            offset += DWORD;
        }
        if (hasCompressedSize) {
            compressedSize = new ZipEightByteInteger(rawCentralDirectoryData,
                                                     offset);
            offset += DWORD;
        }
        if (hasRelativeHeaderOffset) {
            relativeHeaderOffset =
                new ZipEightByteInteger(rawCentralDirectoryData, offset);
            offset += DWORD;
        }
        if (hasDiskStart) {
            diskStart = new ZipLong(rawCentralDirectoryData, offset);
            offset += WORD;
        }
    }
}
```
In this corrected version, the function checks that the length of the `rawCentralDirectoryData` field is at least as long as the expected length, based on the presence of the flags. If the length is not long enough, it throws a `ZipException` with a message indicating that the length of the extra field does not match the length of the central directory data.
