 The buggy function is trying to access an element of the `pathNames` array at index `-1`, which is out of bounds. This is caused by the `stackSize - 2` expression, which is evaluated to `-1` when `stackSize` is 0.

To fix the bug, the function should check if `stackSize` is 0 before accessing the `pathNames` array. Here's the corrected function:
```
@Override
public void skipValue() throws IOException {
  if (peek() == JsonToken.NAME) {
    nextName();
    if (stackSize > 0) {
      pathNames[stackSize - 2] = "null";
    }
  } else {
    popStack();
    if (stackSize > 0) {
      pathNames[stackSize - 1] = "null";
    }
  }
  pathIndices[stackSize - 1]++;
}
```
