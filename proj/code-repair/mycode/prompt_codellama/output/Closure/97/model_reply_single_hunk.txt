 The correct line at the INFILL location should be:

    result = lvalInt >>> rvalInt;

This is the correct implementation of the `>>>` operator for JavaScript, which is different from the Java `>>>` operator. In JavaScript, the `>>>` operator performs a zero-fill right shift, which means that it fills the leftmost bits with zeros and shifts the remaining bits to the right. In Java, the `>>>` operator performs an arithmetic right shift, which means that it fills the leftmost bits with the sign bit and shifts the remaining bits to the right.

The buggy hunk in the original code was using the Java `>>>` operator, which is not correct for JavaScript. The correct implementation is to use the JavaScript `>>>` operator, which is the `>>>` symbol followed by a space.
