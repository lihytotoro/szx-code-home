 The bug in the code is in the line `if (c < '0' || c > '9') { return false; }`. This line is checking if the character at the current index is a digit, but it is not checking if the character is a digit in the correct range.

The correct version of the function should be:
```
static boolean isSimpleNumber(String s) {
  int len = s.length();
  for (int index = 0; index < len; index++) {
    char c = s.charAt(index);
    if (c < '0' || c > '9') {
      return false;
    }
  }
  return len > 0 && s.charAt(0) != '0';
}
```
This version of the function checks if the character at the current index is a digit in the correct range, and returns `false` if it is not. The function then checks if the length of the string is greater than 0 and if the first character is not equal to 0, and returns `true` if both conditions are met.

The corrected function should pass the test `testIssue942` with the following test error:
```
junit.framework.ComparisonFailure: expected:<var x={0:1}> but was:<var x={["0"]:1}>
```
