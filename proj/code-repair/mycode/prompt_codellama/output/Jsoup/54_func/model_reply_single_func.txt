 The bug in the code is that it is not properly sanitizing the attribute names before setting them on the `Element`. The `replaceAll` method is not the correct way to sanitize the attribute names, as it only replaces the first occurrence of the pattern.

To fix the bug, you can use the `replaceAll` method with a regular expression that matches any invalid characters in the attribute name, and replace them with an empty string. Here's the corrected code:
```java
private void copyAttributes(org.jsoup.nodes.Node source, Element el) {
    for (Attribute attribute : source.attributes()) {
        String key = attribute.getKey().replaceAll("[^a-zA-Z_:][-a-zA-Z0-9_:.]", "");
        el.setAttribute(key, attribute.getValue());
    }
}
```
This code will replace any invalid characters in the attribute name with an empty string, ensuring that the attribute name is valid XML.
