 The bug in the function is that it returns `true` when the character `ch` is a supplementary character, even though it should only return `true` if `ch` is in the Basic Multilingual Plane.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```
public static boolean containsAny(CharSequence cs, char[] searchChars) {
    if (isEmpty(cs) || ArrayUtils.isEmpty(searchChars)) {
        return false;
    }
    int csLength = cs.length();
    int searchLength = searchChars.length;
    for (int i = 0; i < csLength; i++) {
        char ch = cs.charAt(i);
        if (ch < Character.MIN_SUPPLEMENTARY_CODE_POINT) {
            for (int j = 0; j < searchLength; j++) {
                if (searchChars[j] == ch) {
                    return true;
                }
            }
        } else {
            for (int j = 0; j < searchLength; j++) {
                if (searchChars[j] == ch || searchChars[j] == Character.toLowerCase(ch)) {
                    return true;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```
This version checks if `ch` is a supplementary character and if so, it checks if it is in the Basic Multilingual Plane by comparing it to `Character.MIN_SUPPLEMENTARY_CODE_POINT`. If `ch` is not a supplementary character, it checks if it is in the search array by comparing it to each element in the array. If `ch` is a supplementary character, it checks if it is in the search array by comparing it to each element in the array, and if it is, it also checks if it is in the Basic Multilingual Plane by comparing it to `Character.MIN_SUPPLEMENTARY_CODE_POINT`.
