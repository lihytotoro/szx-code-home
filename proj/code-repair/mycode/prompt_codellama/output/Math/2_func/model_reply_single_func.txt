 The buggy function is:
```
public double getNumericalMean() {
    return (double) (getSampleSize() * getNumberOfSuccesses()) / (double) getPopulationSize();
}
```
The bug is in the calculation of the sample size. The formula for the sample size is:
```
sampleSize = (populationSize * sampleProportion) / (1 - sampleProportion)
```
where `sampleProportion` is the proportion of successes in the sample, and `populationSize` is the total number of items in the population.

In the buggy function, the sample size is calculated as:
```
sampleSize = (getPopulationSize() * getNumberOfSuccesses()) / (double) getPopulationSize()
```
This is incorrect because the sample size is calculated using the total number of items in the population, rather than the sample proportion.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to use the correct formula for the sample size:
```
public double getNumericalMean() {
    return (double) (getPopulationSize() * getNumberOfSuccesses()) / (double) (getPopulationSize() * (1 - getSampleProportion()));
}
```
This function calculates the sample size using the correct formula, and returns the correct numerical mean.
