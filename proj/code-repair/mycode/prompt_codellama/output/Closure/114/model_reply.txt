 The correct line at the INFILL location should be:
```
recordDepScope(recordNode, ns);
```
This line is responsible for recording the dependency scope of the assignment expression, which is the scope in which the assigned variable is defined.

The original buggy line:
```
} else {
```
was removed because it was not necessary and was causing the code to fail the test. The test was expecting the assignment expression to be recorded as a dependency scope, but the original code was not doing that.

By adding the correct line at the INFILL location, the code will now record the dependency scope of the assignment expression, which will fix the test error.
