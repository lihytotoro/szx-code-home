 The correct line at the INFILL location is:
```
_hashArea = Arrays.copyOf(_hashArea, _hashArea.length);
```
This line is necessary to ensure that the `_hashArea` array is properly initialized before it is used. The buggy line that was removed was:
```
_hashArea = Arrays.copyOf(_hashArea, _hashArea.length);
```
This line was not necessary and was causing the `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` error.
