 The bug in the code is that the `getInitialDomain` function is using the mean of the distribution as the initial domain, but this is not a valid value for the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method.

The correct version of the function should use the `getDenominatorDegreesOfFreedom` method to get the correct initial domain, like this:
```
protected double getInitialDomain(double p) {
    double ret;
    double d = getDenominatorDegreesOfFreedom();
    ret = d / (d - 2.0);
    return ret;
}
```
This will ensure that the initial domain is valid and the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method can be used correctly.
