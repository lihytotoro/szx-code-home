 The correct line at the INFILL location is:

```
if (!preserveRelativeLinks)
    attr.setValue(value);
```

This line is setting the value of the `attr` attribute to the absolute URL of the element, which is obtained by calling the `absUrl` method on the element. The `preserveRelativeLinks` variable is set to `false`, so this line is only executed if the `preserveRelativeLinks` variable is `false`.

The buggy hunk that was removed was:

```
if (!preserveRelativeLinks)
    attr.setValue(value);
```

This line was causing the `attr` attribute to be set to the absolute URL of the element, even if the `preserveRelativeLinks` variable was `true`. This was causing the test to fail, as the test was expecting the `attr` attribute to be set to the relative URL of the element.
