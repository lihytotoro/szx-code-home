 The correct line at the INFILL location is:
```
if (!validProperties.contains(propName)) {
  if (NodeUtil.isVarOrSimpleAssignLhs(parent, gramps)) {
    validProperties.add(propName);
  } else {
    return false;
  }
}
```
This code checks if the property being referenced is defined on the object literal, and if it is not, it returns false. This is necessary because the object-splitting algorithm assumes that if a property is not defined on an object, then the value is undefined. However, this assumption is not always true, as properties can be added to the `Object.prototype` object.

The code checks if the property is defined on the object literal by checking if it is a valid property of the object. If the property is not defined on the object literal, it checks if the property is a variable or a simple assignment statement, and if it is, it adds the property to the set of valid properties. If the property is not a variable or a simple assignment statement, it returns false.

The code also checks if the property is self-referential, which means that it is assigned a value that is the parent of one of the passed in references. If the property is self-referential, it returns false, as this can cause problems with the object-splitting algorithm.

Overall, this code checks if the property being referenced is defined on the object literal, and if it is not, it returns false. This is necessary to prevent the object-splitting algorithm from inlining deleted properties, which can cause problems with the code.
