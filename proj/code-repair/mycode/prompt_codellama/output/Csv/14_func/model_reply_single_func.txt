 The bug is in the `printAndEscape` method, which is called when `quoteModePolicy` is `NONE`. The method is supposed to escape any special characters in the input string, but it is not doing so correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the `printAndEscape` method:
```
private void printAndEscape(final CharSequence value, final int offset, final int len, final Appendable out) throws IOException {
    int pos = offset;
    final int end = offset + len;

    while (pos < end) {
        final char c = value.charAt(pos);
        if (c == '\\' || c == '"') {
            out.append('\\');
        }
        out.append(c);
        pos++;
    }
}
```
This corrected version of the method properly escapes any special characters in the input string, including the backslash and double quote characters.
