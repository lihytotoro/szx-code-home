 The buggy function is:
```
public Line revert() {
    final Line reverted = new Line(zero, zero.subtract(direction));
    return reverted;
}
```
The correct version of the function should be:
```
public Line revert() {
    final Line reverted = new Line(zero, direction.negate());
    return reverted;
}
```
The bug was in the `subtract` method, which was used to calculate the new direction of the line. The correct way to negate a vector is to use the `negate` method, which returns a new vector with the opposite direction.

The test error was caused by the fact that the `subtract` method was not negating the direction vector correctly, resulting in a small difference between the expected and actual values.
