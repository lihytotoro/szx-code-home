 The correct line at the INFILL location is:
```
dataNode = TextNode.createFromEncoded(data, baseUri);
```
This line creates a new `TextNode` from the encoded data, which is then appended to the `child` element. The `TextNode` is created with the `baseUri` as its base URI, which is used to resolve relative URLs in the node.
