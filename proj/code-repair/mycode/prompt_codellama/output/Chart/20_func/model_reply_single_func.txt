 The bug in the code is that the `outlinePaint` and `outlineStroke` parameters are not being used correctly. The `outlinePaint` parameter is being used as the `paint` parameter for the `super` constructor, which is not correct. The `outlineStroke` parameter is being used as the `stroke` parameter for the `super` constructor, which is also not correct.

The correct version of the function should be:
```
public ValueMarker(double value, Paint paint, Stroke stroke, 
                   Paint outlinePaint, Stroke outlineStroke, float alpha) {
    super(paint, stroke, outlinePaint, outlineStroke, alpha);
    this.value = value;
}
```
This version of the function correctly uses the `outlinePaint` and `outlineStroke` parameters as the `paint` and `stroke` parameters for the `super` constructor, respectively.
