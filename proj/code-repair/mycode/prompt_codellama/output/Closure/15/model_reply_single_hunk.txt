 The correct line at the INFILL location is:
```
if (n.isCall() && NodeUtil.functionCallHasSideEffects(n)) {
  return true;
}
```
This line checks if the current node is a function call and if it has side effects. If it does, the function returns `true`, indicating that the current node has side effects.
