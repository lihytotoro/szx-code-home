 The correct line at the INFILL location is:
```
if ("select".equals(el.normalName())) {
    Elements options = el.select("option[selected]");
    boolean set = false;
    for (Element option: options) {
        data.add(HttpConnection.KeyVal.create(name, option.val()));
        set = true;
    }
    if (!set) {
        Element option = el.select("option").first();
        if (option != null)
            data.add(HttpConnection.KeyVal.create(name, option.val()));
    }
}
```
The bug was caused by the fact that the `select` element was not being properly handled in the `formData` method. The method was only checking if the `select` element had the `selected` attribute, but it was not checking if any of the options were selected. This resulted in the `select` element being added to the `data` list even if no options were selected, which caused the test to fail.

The corrected code checks if any of the options are selected and adds the selected option to the `data` list. If no options are selected, it adds the first option to the `data` list. This ensures that the `select` element is properly handled and the test passes.
