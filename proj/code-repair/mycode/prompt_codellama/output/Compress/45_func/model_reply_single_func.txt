 The buggy function is:
```
public static int formatLongOctalOrBinaryBytes(
    final long value, final byte[] buf, final int offset, final int length) {

    // Check whether we are dealing with UID/GID or SIZE field
    final long maxAsOctalChar = length == TarConstants.UIDLEN ? TarConstants.MAXID : TarConstants.MAXSIZE;

    final boolean negative = value < 0;
    if (!negative && value <= maxAsOctalChar) { // OK to store as octal chars
        return formatLongOctalBytes(value, buf, offset, length);
    }

    if (length < 9) {
        formatLongBinary(value, buf, offset, length, negative);
    }
    formatBigIntegerBinary(value, buf, offset, length, negative);

    buf[offset] = (byte) (negative ? 0xff : 0x80);
    return offset + length;
}
```
The bug is in the line `final long maxAsOctalChar = length == TarConstants.UIDLEN ? TarConstants.MAXID : TarConstants.MAXSIZE;`.

The variable `maxAsOctalChar` is used to determine whether the value can be stored as octal characters. However, the value of `maxAsOctalChar` is not correctly calculated.

If `length` is equal to `TarConstants.UIDLEN`, then `maxAsOctalChar` should be set to `TarConstants.MAXID`, which is the maximum value that can be stored as an octal character in a UID field.

However, the current code sets `maxAsOctalChar` to `TarConstants.MAXSIZE`, which is the maximum value that can be stored as an octal character in a SIZE field.

Therefore, the function is incorrectly calculating the maximum value that can be stored as octal characters, and it is not correctly handling the case where `length` is equal to `TarConstants.UIDLEN`.

To fix the bug, the line should be changed to:
```
final long maxAsOctalChar = length == TarConstants.UIDLEN ? TarConstants.MAXID : TarConstants.MAXSIZE;
```
This will correctly calculate the maximum value that can be stored as octal characters, and it will correctly handle the case where `length` is equal to `TarConstants.UIDLEN`.
