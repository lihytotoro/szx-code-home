 The bug in the code is that it modifies the `attributes` map while iterating over its keys using an iterator. This is not allowed in Java, and it results in a `ConcurrentModificationException`.

To fix the bug, we need to create a copy of the iterator before iterating over the keys, and then use the copy to remove the keys. Here's the corrected code:
```
public void removeIgnoreCase(String key) {
    Validate.notEmpty(key);
    if (attributes == null)
        return;
    Iterator<String> it = attributes.keySet().iterator();
    while (it.hasNext()) {
        String attrKey = it.next();
        if (attrKey.equalsIgnoreCase(key))
            it.remove();
    }
}
```
This code creates a copy of the iterator using the `iterator()` method, and then uses the copy to remove the keys. This ensures that the iterator is not modified while iterating over its keys, and avoids the `ConcurrentModificationException`.
