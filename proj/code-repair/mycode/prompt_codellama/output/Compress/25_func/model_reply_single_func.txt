 The buggy function is:
```
public ZipArchiveInputStream(InputStream inputStream,
                             String encoding,
                             boolean useUnicodeExtraFields,
                             boolean allowStoredEntriesWithDataDescriptor) {
    zipEncoding = ZipEncodingHelper.getZipEncoding(encoding);
    this.useUnicodeExtraFields = useUnicodeExtraFields;
    in = new PushbackInputStream(inputStream, buf.capacity());
    this.allowStoredEntriesWithDataDescriptor =
        allowStoredEntriesWithDataDescriptor;
    // haven't read anything so far
}
```
The bug is in the line `in = new PushbackInputStream(inputStream, buf.capacity());`. The `buf.capacity()` method returns the capacity of the buffer, which is not the same as the number of bytes that have been read. The `PushbackInputStream` class expects the number of bytes that have been read, not the capacity of the buffer.

The corrected function should be:
```
public ZipArchiveInputStream(InputStream inputStream,
                             String encoding,
                             boolean useUnicodeExtraFields,
                             boolean allowStoredEntriesWithDataDescriptor) {
    zipEncoding = ZipEncodingHelper.getZipEncoding(encoding);
    this.useUnicodeExtraFields = useUnicodeExtraFields;
    in = new PushbackInputStream(inputStream, 0);
    this.allowStoredEntriesWithDataDescriptor =
        allowStoredEntriesWithDataDescriptor;
    // haven't read anything so far
}
```
In this corrected version, the `PushbackInputStream` constructor is called with a `0` as the second argument, which indicates that no bytes have been read. This is the correct way to initialize the `PushbackInputStream` class.
