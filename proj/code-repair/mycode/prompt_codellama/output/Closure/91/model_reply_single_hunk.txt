 The correct line at the INFILL location is:
```
if (jsDoc != null &&
        (jsDoc.isConstructor() ||
         jsDoc.isInterface() ||
         jsDoc.hasThisType() ||
         jsDoc.isOverride())) {
      return false;
    }
```
This line checks if the function being traversed is a constructor, interface, or has the `@this` or `@override` annotation, and if so, it returns `false` to prevent traversal. This is the buggy code that was removed.
