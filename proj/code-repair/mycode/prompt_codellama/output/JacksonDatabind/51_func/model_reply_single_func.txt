 The bug is caused by the line `deser = ctxt.findContextualValueDeserializer(type, _property);`. The `findContextualValueDeserializer` method returns a deserializer for the given type, but it does not take into account the property that the deserializer is being used for. This means that the deserializer returned by this method may not be compatible with the property, which can lead to a `JsonMappingException` when trying to deserialize the property.

To fix the bug, we need to pass the property to the `findContextualValueDeserializer` method. We can do this by changing the line to `deser = ctxt.findContextualValueDeserializer(type, _property);`. This will ensure that the deserializer returned by the method is compatible with the property.
