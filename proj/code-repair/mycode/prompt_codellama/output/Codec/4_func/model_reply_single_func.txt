 The buggy function is:
```
public Base64() {
    this(false);
}
```
The correct version of the function should be:
```
public Base64() {
    this(true);
}
```
The bug is that the constructor is calling `this(false)` instead of `this(true)`. This is because the `false` value is being passed as the `b` parameter to the `Base64` constructor, which is not what is intended.

The corrected function should call `this(true)` to initialize the `b` parameter to `true`, which is the correct value for the `Base64` constructor.
