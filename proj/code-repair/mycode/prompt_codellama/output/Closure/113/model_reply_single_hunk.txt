 The correct line at the INFILL location should be:

    if (provided != null && !provided.isExplicitlyProvided()) {

This is because the `provided` variable is a `ProvidedName` object, and the `isExplicitlyProvided()` method checks if the provided name was explicitly provided by a `goog.provide()` statement. If the provided name was not explicitly provided, then it is considered undeclared.
