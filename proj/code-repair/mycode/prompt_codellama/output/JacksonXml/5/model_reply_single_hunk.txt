 The correct line at the INFILL location should be:
```
_rootNameLookup = null;
```
This sets the `_rootNameLookup` field to `null`, which is the correct behavior for the `XmlSerializerProvider` constructor. The original buggy hunk was trying to copy the `src._rootNameLookup` field, which is not necessary and can cause problems.
