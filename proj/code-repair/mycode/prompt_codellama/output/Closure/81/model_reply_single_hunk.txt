 The correct line at the INFILL location is:
```
if (name == null) {
    name = new Name();
    name.setIdentifier("");
    isUnnamedFunction = true;
}
```
This line is checking if the function name is null, and if so, it creates a new name object with an empty identifier and sets the `isUnnamedFunction` flag to true. This is necessary because the Rhino parser does not always create a name object for unnamed functions, and the `transform` method relies on the presence of a name object to correctly parse the function.
