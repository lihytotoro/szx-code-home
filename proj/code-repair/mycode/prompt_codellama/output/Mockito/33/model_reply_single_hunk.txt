 The correct line at the INFILL location should be:
```
return m1.equals(m2);
```
This is the original buggy hunk that was removed, and it was causing the test to fail. The bug was that the method `equals()` was not being used correctly, and it was causing the test to fail. The correct way to compare two `Method` objects is to use the `equals()` method, as shown in the corrected code.
