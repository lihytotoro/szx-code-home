 The bug in the code is that it is comparing the object reference of `this` with the object reference of `o` instead of comparing the contents of the objects.

The corrected version of the function should be:
```
public boolean equals(Object o) {
    if (this == o) return true;
    if (o == null || getClass() != o.getClass()) return false;
    if (!super.equals(o)) return false;

    Element element = (Element) o;

    return this.text().equals(element.text());
}
```
This function first checks if the object references are the same, and if not, it checks if the objects are of the same class and if their contents are equal.

Note that the `text()` method is used to get the text content of the element, which is what is being compared in the `equals` method.
