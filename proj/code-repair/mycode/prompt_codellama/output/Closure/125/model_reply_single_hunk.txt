 The correct line at the INFILL location is:
```
if (fnType != null) {
```
This line is checking if the function type is not null, which is a bug in the original code. The function type should be checked for null before it is used.

The corrected code should be:
```
if (fnType != null) {
  visitParameterList(t, n, fnType);
  ensureTyped(t, n, fnType.getInstanceType());
} else {
  ensureTyped(t, n);
}
```
This code checks if the function type is not null before using it, and if it is null, it uses the `ensureTyped` method with the `n` node as the argument.
