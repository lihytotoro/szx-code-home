 The buggy function is:
```
public String html() {
    StringBuilder accum = new StringBuilder();
    html(accum);
    return accum.toString().trim();
}
```
The bug is that the `html` method is not properly escaping the HTML characters in the `accum` string builder. This means that the resulting HTML string will not be properly formatted and will contain unescaped HTML characters.

To fix the bug, we need to properly escape the HTML characters in the `accum` string builder. One way to do this is to use the `StringEscapeUtils.escapeHtml` method from the `org.apache.commons.lang3.StringEscapeUtils` class. Here is the corrected version of the `html` method:
```
public String html() {
    StringBuilder accum = new StringBuilder();
    html(accum);
    return StringEscapeUtils.escapeHtml(accum.toString()).trim();
}
```
With this correction, the `html` method will properly escape the HTML characters in the `accum` string builder, and the resulting HTML string will be properly formatted and contain the expected HTML tags and attributes.
