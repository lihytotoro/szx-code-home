 The correct line at the INFILL location is:
```
return new SimpleType(subclass, _bindings, _superClass, _superInterfaces,
```
This line creates a new instance of the `SimpleType` class, which is the type that the `_valueHandler` and `_typeHandler` fields are expected to be. The `subclass` parameter is the class that the `SimpleType` instance should be constructed with, and the `_bindings`, `_superClass`, and `_superInterfaces` parameters are used to configure the `SimpleType` instance.

The buggy hunk that was removed was attempting to use the `SimpleType` class as a `JavaType` instance, which is not correct. The `SimpleType` class is a subclass of `JavaType`, but it is not a valid `JavaType` instance. The `JavaType` interface defines a set of methods that are used to access the type information of a Java object, and the `SimpleType` class does not implement these methods correctly.

The buggy hunk was attempting to use the `SimpleType` class as a `JavaType` instance by calling the `narrow` method on it, which is not allowed. The `narrow` method is used to create a new instance of a `JavaType` subclass that is a sub-type of the current instance. The `SimpleType` class is not a valid `JavaType` instance, so it cannot be narrowed to a sub-type of itself.

The correct line at the INFILL location is the one that creates a new instance of the `SimpleType` class, which is the correct type that the `_valueHandler` and `_typeHandler` fields are expected to be.
