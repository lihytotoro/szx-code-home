 The correct line at the INFILL location should be:
```
currEntry = new TarArchiveEntry(headerBuf, entrySize);
```
This is because the `TarArchiveEntry` constructor takes an additional `entrySize` parameter, which is used to set the size of the entry. The `entrySize` variable is already set to the correct value, so we can pass it directly to the constructor.

With this change, the code should work correctly and pass the test.
