 ```
if (val.startsWith("--")) {
    // this is protection for poorness in java.lang.BigDecimal.
    // it accepts this as a legal value, but it does not appear 
    // to be in specification of class. OS X Java parses it to 
    // a wrong value.
    return null;
}
```
The buggy hunk was removed because it was causing a `StringIndexOutOfBoundsException` when the input string starts with "--". This is because the code was trying to access the first character of the string, but the string was empty. The fix is to return `null` instead of trying to access the first character of the empty string.
