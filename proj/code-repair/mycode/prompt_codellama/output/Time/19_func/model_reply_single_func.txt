 The bug is in the `getOffsetFromLocal` function, which is supposed to return the offset from local time to UTC, but it is not correctly handling the case where the local time is near a DST boundary.

The function is using the `getOffset` method to get the offset at the instant `instantLocal`, and then adjusting the instant using the offset and recalculating the offset. However, if the offsets differ, it is not correctly handling the case where the local time is near a DST boundary.

Here is the corrected version of the `getOffsetFromLocal` function:
```
public int getOffsetFromLocal(long instantLocal) {
    // get the offset at instantLocal (first estimate)
    final int offsetLocal = getOffset(instantLocal);
    // adjust instantLocal using the estimate and recalc the offset
    final long instantAdjusted = instantLocal - offsetLocal;
    final int offsetAdjusted = getOffset(instantAdjusted);
    // if the offsets differ, we must be near a DST boundary
    if (offsetLocal != offsetAdjusted) {
        // we need to ensure that time is always after the DST gap
        // this happens naturally for positive offsets, but not for negative
        if ((offsetLocal - offsetAdjusted) < 0) {
            // if we just return offsetAdjusted then the time is pushed
            // back before the transition, whereas it should be
            // on or after the transition
            long nextLocal = nextTransition(instantAdjusted);
            long nextAdjusted = nextTransition(instantLocal - offsetAdjusted);
            if (nextLocal != nextAdjusted) {
                return offsetLocal;
            }
        }
    } else if (offsetLocal > 0) {
        long prev = previousTransition(instantAdjusted);
        if (prev < instantAdjusted) {
            int offsetPrev = getOffset(prev);
            int diff = offsetPrev - offsetLocal;
            if (instantAdjusted - prev <= diff) {
                return offsetPrev;
            }
        }
    }
    return offsetAdjusted;
}
```
This corrected version of the function correctly handles the case where the local time is near a DST boundary, by checking if the offsets differ and if the local time is before the DST gap. If it is, it returns the offset at the previous transition, which should be the offset before the DST gap.
