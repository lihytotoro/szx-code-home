 The buggy function is:
```
protected BasePeriod(long duration) {
    this(duration, null, null);
    // bug [3264409]
}
```
The correct version of the function should be:
```
protected BasePeriod(long duration) {
    this(duration, null, null);
    // bug [3264409]
    this.weeks = 0;
}
```
The bug is that the `weeks` field is not initialized to 0, so the `getWeeks()` method returns the default value of 64. By adding the line `this.weeks = 0;` after the call to the superclass constructor, the bug is fixed and the `getWeeks()` method returns 0 as expected.
