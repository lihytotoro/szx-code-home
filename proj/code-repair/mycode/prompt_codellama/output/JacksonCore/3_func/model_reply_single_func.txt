 The bug is in the line:
```
_inputPtr = start;
```
The variable `start` is not being used correctly. It should be used as the starting position of the input buffer, but it is being used as the ending position of the input buffer.

The correct version of the function would be:
```
public UTF8StreamJsonParser(IOContext ctxt, int features, InputStream in,
        ObjectCodec codec, BytesToNameCanonicalizer sym,
        byte[] inputBuffer, int start, int end,
        boolean bufferRecyclable)
{
    super(ctxt, features);
    _inputStream = in;
    _objectCodec = codec;
    _symbols = sym;
    _inputBuffer = inputBuffer;
    _inputPtr = start;
    _inputEnd = end;
    // If we have offset, need to omit that from byte offset, so:
    _bufferRecyclable = bufferRecyclable;
}
```
In this version, the variable `start` is used correctly as the starting position of the input buffer, and the variable `end` is used correctly as the ending position of the input buffer.
