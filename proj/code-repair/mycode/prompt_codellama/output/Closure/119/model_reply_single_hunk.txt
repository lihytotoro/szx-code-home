 The correct line at the INFILL location is:
```
case Token.INC:
case Token.DEC:
  isSet = true;
  type = Name.Type.OTHER;
  break;
```
This case statement is responsible for handling the `++` and `--` operators, which are used to increment and decrement variables. The `isSet` variable is set to `true` to indicate that the name is being set, and the `type` variable is set to `Name.Type.OTHER` to indicate that the name is being set to a value that is not a function.
