 The bug in the code is that the `StringBuffer` is not being properly initialized. The `append` method is being called on a `StringBuffer` that has not been initialized, which results in a `NullPointerException`.

Here is the corrected version of the code:
```
private void checkRequiredOptions()
    throws MissingOptionException
{
    // if there are required options that have not been
    // processsed
    if (requiredOptions.size() > 0)
    {
        Iterator iter = requiredOptions.iterator();
        StringBuffer buff = new StringBuffer();

        // loop through the required options
        while (iter.hasNext())
        {
            buff.append(iter.next());
        }

        throw new MissingOptionException(buff.toString());
    }
}
```
In this version, the `StringBuffer` is initialized with the `new` operator before being used. This ensures that the `append` method is called on a valid `StringBuffer` object.
