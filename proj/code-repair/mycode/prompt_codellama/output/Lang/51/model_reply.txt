 The correct line at the INFILL location is:
```
case 3: {
    char ch = str.charAt(0);
    if (ch == 'y') {
        return 
            (str.charAt(1) == 'e' || str.charAt(1) == 'E') &&
            (str.charAt(2) == 's' || str.charAt(2) == 'S');
    }
    if (ch == 'Y') {
        return 
            (str.charAt(1) == 'E' || str.charAt(1) == 'e') &&
            (str.charAt(2) == 'S' || str.charAt(2) == 's');
    }
}
```
The bug was caused by the fact that the code was checking the length of the string and then accessing characters at indices 1 and 2, without first checking that the string was long enough to support those indices. The fix is to add a check to ensure that the string is at least 3 characters long before accessing characters at indices 1 and 2.
