 The bug in the code is in the `burstToken` method, which is called when a token that starts with a hyphen but is not a long option is encountered. The method is supposed to split the token into multiple tokens, but it is not doing so correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the `burstToken` method:
```
protected void burstToken(String token, boolean stopAtNonOption) {
    // split the token into multiple tokens
    String[] parts = token.split("-");
    for (String part : parts) {
        if (part.length() > 0) {
            tokens.add(part);
        }
    }
}
```
This version of the method splits the token into multiple tokens using the `-` character as the delimiter. It then adds each part of the token to the `tokens` list.

With this correction, the `flatten` method should work correctly.
