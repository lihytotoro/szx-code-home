 The correct line at the INFILL location is:
```
if (constraintObj != null && constraintObj.isRecordType()) {
```
This line checks if the `constraintObj` is a record type, and if it is, it proceeds to the next step. The buggy hunk was removed because it was not necessary and it was causing the type inference to fail.
