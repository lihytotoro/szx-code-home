 The correct line at the INFILL location is:
```
buffer.assignParameter(typeProp, ctxt.findContextualValueDeserializer(typeProp.getType(), ctxt).deserialize(p, ctxt));
```
This line is needed to fix the buggy hunk by assigning the value of the `typeId` property to the `typeProp` property. The `typeProp` property is a `SettableBeanProperty` that represents the type property of the `AnimalAndType` class. The `findContextualValueDeserializer` method is used to find the deserializer for the `typeProp` property, and the `deserialize` method is used to deserialize the value of the `typeId` property. The resulting value is then assigned to the `typeProp` property using the `assignParameter` method.
