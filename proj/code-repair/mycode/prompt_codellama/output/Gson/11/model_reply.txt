 The correct line at the INFILL location is:
```
return new LazilyParsedNumber(in.nextString());
```
This line is missing from the original code, and it is the correct implementation of the `read` method for the `Number` type adapter. The `LazilyParsedNumber` class is a custom implementation of the `Number` interface that lazily parses the string representation of the number when it is accessed.
