 The correct line at the INFILL location should be:

if (rawCentralDirectoryData.length != expectedLength) {

This line checks if the length of the raw central directory data matches the expected length based on the flags passed in. If the lengths don't match, it throws a ZipException with a message indicating that the length of the central directory data doesn't match the expected length.
