 The correct line at the INFILL location is:
```
int greater = replacementList[i].length() - searchList[i].length();
if (greater > 0) {
    increase += 3 * greater; // assume 3 matches
}
```
This line is causing the null pointer exception because `replacementList[i]` is null, and you are trying to call the `length()` method on it.
