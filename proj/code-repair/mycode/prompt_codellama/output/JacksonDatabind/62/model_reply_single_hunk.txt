 The correct line at the INFILL location is:
```
JsonDeserializer<Object> delegateDeser = null;
```
This line is used to initialize the `delegateDeser` variable, which is used later in the method. The buggy hunk was removed because it was causing the `delegateDeser` variable to be initialized to `null` instead of the correct value.
