 The correct line at the INFILL location is:

if (!inAttribute || escapeMode == EscapeMode.xhtml)

This change is necessary because the original code was escaping the `<` character in XML attributes, which is not valid. By adding the `|| escapeMode == EscapeMode.xhtml` condition, we ensure that the `<` character is only escaped in XML attributes if the `EscapeMode` is set to `xhtml`.
