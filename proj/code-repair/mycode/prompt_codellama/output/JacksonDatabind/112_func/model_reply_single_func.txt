 The bug is caused by the fact that the `DelegatingArrayCreator` class is not annotated with `@JsonCreator` and therefore does not have a default no-arguments constructor. This is a requirement for Jackson to be able to deserialize the class.

To fix the bug, you can add the `@JsonCreator` annotation to the `DelegatingArrayCreator` class, like this:
```
@JsonCreator
public DelegatingArrayCreator() {
    // ...
}
```
Alternatively, you can add a default no-arguments constructor to the `DelegatingArrayCreator` class, like this:
```
public DelegatingArrayCreator() {
    // ...
}
```
Either of these solutions should fix the bug and allow the test to pass.
