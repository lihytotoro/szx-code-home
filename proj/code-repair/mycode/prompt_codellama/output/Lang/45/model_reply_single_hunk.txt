 The correct line at the INFILL location is:
```
if (upper == -1 || upper > str.length()) {
    upper = str.length();
}
```
This line checks if the `upper` value is -1 or greater than the length of the string, and if so, sets `upper` to the length of the string. This is necessary because the `abbreviate` method is supposed to return the entire string if the `upper` value is -1 or greater than the length of the string.
