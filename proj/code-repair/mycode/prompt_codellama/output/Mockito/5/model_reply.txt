 The correct line at the INFILL location should be:

catch (org.mockito.exceptions.verification.ArgumentsAreDifferent e) {

This is the correct exception to catch, as the method is using the `org.mockito.exceptions.verification.ArgumentsAreDifferent` exception to indicate that the arguments passed to the mocked method are different from the expected arguments.
