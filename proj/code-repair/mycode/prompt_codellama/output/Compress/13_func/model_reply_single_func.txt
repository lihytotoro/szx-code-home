 The buggy function is:
```
protected void setName(String name) {
    this.name = name;
}
```
The correct version of the function should use the `replace` method to replace the backslash with a forward slash:
```
protected void setName(String name) {
    this.name = name.replace("\\", "/");
}
```
This will ensure that the backslash is properly replaced with a forward slash, and the test will pass.
