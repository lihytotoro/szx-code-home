 The bug in the code is that it is using the `charAt()` method to get the character at a specific index in the string, but it is not handling the case where the character is a digit.

The `charAt()` method returns the character at the specified index as a `char` value, which is a single character. However, when the character is a digit, it is actually a number between 0 and 9, and not a character.

In the code, the character is being compared to the characters '0' and '9' to determine if it is a digit. However, this is not correct, because the character '0' has a numerical value of 48, and the character '9' has a numerical value of 57.

To fix the bug, the code should use the `Character.isDigit()` method to determine if the character is a digit. This method returns `true` if the character is a digit, and `false` otherwise.

Here is the corrected code:
```
static boolean isSimpleNumber(String s) {
  int len = s.length();
  for (int index = 0; index < len; index++) {
    char c = s.charAt(index);
    if (!Character.isDigit(c)) {
      return false;
    }
  }
  return len > 0;
}
```
This code will correctly identify whether a string is a simple number or not, regardless of whether the number is represented as a string or not.
