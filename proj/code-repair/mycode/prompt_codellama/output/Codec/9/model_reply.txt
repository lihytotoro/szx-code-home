 The correct line at the INFILL location should be:

long len = binaryData.length;

This line calculates the length of the input array and assigns it to the variable "len". The buggy line that was removed was:

long len = getEncodeLength(binaryData, MIME_CHUNK_SIZE, CHUNK_SEPARATOR);

This line was not necessary and was causing the error in the test case.
