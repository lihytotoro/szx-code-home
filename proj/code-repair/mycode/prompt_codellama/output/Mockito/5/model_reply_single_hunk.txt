 The correct line at the INFILL location should be:

catch (org.mockito.exceptions.verification.ArgumentsAreDifferent e) {

This is the correct exception that the code is catching, and it is a Mockito exception that is thrown when the arguments passed to a mocked method are different from the expected arguments.
