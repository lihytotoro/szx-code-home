 The correct line at the INFILL location is:
```
buffer[size + strLen + i] = padChar;
```
This line is trying to access the `buffer` array with an index that is out of bounds. The `size` variable is incremented by the `width` variable, which is the number of characters to be appended to the `StrBuilder`. The `strLen` variable is the length of the string to be appended. The `padLen` variable is the number of padding characters to be added.

The bug in the original code is that the `buffer` array is not large enough to hold the entire string, including the padding characters. The `ensureCapacity` method is used to ensure that the `buffer` array is large enough, but it is not called with the correct size. The correct size should be `size + width`, not `size + strLen`.

The corrected line at the INFILL location is:
```
buffer[size + width + i] = padChar;
```
This line accesses the `buffer` array with an index that is within the bounds of the array, and it correctly accounts for the padding characters.
