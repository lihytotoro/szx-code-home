 The correct line at the INFILL location is:

    _initWithRootName((ToXmlGenerator) jgen, ROOT_NAME_FOR_NULL);

This line was removed from the code, but it was necessary to fix the bug. The buggy hunk was:

    if (jgen instanceof ToXmlGenerator) {
        _initWithRootName((ToXmlGenerator) jgen, ROOT_NAME_FOR_NULL);
    }

This code was checking if the `jgen` object was an instance of `ToXmlGenerator`, and if so, it was initializing the root name for the null value. However, this code was not necessary, as the `ToXmlGenerator` class already had a default root name for null values. Therefore, the line was removed, and the bug was fixed.
