 The correct line at the INFILL location should be:

if (MathUtils.compareTo(entry, 0, epsilon) > 0) {

This is because the `compareTo` method returns a negative value if the first argument is less than the second argument, a positive value if the first argument is greater than the second argument, and zero if the arguments are equal. In this case, we want to check if the entry is greater than zero, so we should use the `>` operator instead of `>=`.
