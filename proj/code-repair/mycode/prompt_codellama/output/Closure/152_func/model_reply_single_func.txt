 The bug is caused by the fact that the `MyTypedef` typedef is defined as a `string` type, but the function `f` is annotated with `@this {MyTypedef}`, which expects the type to be an `ObjectType`.

The correct version of the function should be:
```
/** @this {ObjectType} */ function f() {}
```
This will ensure that the type of `this` in the function `f` is an `ObjectType`, which is what the `@this` annotation expects.
