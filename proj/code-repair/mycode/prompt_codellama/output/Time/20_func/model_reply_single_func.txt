 The buggy function is:
```
public int parseInto(DateTimeParserBucket bucket, String text, int position) {
    String str = text.substring(position);
    for (String id : ALL_IDS) {
        if (str.startsWith(id)) {
            bucket.setZone(DateTimeZone.forID(id));
            return position + id.length();
        }
    }
    return ~position;
}
```
The bug is in the `return ~position;` statement. The `~` operator is the bitwise NOT operator, which returns the negative of the operand. In this case, it is returning the negative of the `position` variable, which is the index of the first character in the string that was not parsed.

The correct version of the function should return the index of the first character in the string that was parsed, which is the length of the ID that was parsed plus the position of the first character in the string. The corrected function should be:
```
public int parseInto(DateTimeParserBucket bucket, String text, int position) {
    String str = text.substring(position);
    for (String id : ALL_IDS) {
        if (str.startsWith(id)) {
            bucket.setZone(DateTimeZone.forID(id));
            return position + id.length();
        }
    }
    return position + 1;
}
```
This corrected version of the function will return the correct index of the first character in the string that was parsed, which is the length of the ID that was parsed plus the position of the first character in the string.
