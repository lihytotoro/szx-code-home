 The correct line at the INFILL location should be:
```
if (x < 0 && prev == '-') {
```
This is because the buggy line was checking if the previous character was a hyphen, but it should be checking if the previous character was a space. The space is added by the `add(" ")` method call in the previous line, which is intended to prevent misparsing of the number as a negative number.
