 ```
if (endIndex < 0) {
    endIndex = -(endIndex + 1);
    endIndex = endIndex - 1;
}
```
The bug was caused by the incorrect order of operations in the line. The correct line should be:
```
if (endIndex < 0) {
    endIndex = -(endIndex + 1) - 1;
}
```
This will fix the bug and make the code work as expected.
