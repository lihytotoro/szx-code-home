 The buggy hunk was removed, so there is no longer any code at the INFILL location. The correct line should be:
```
((Factory) mock).setCallback(0, newFilter);
```
This line sets the callback for the mock object, which is used to handle method invocations. The buggy hunk was removed, so this line is now the correct way to set the callback for the mock object.
