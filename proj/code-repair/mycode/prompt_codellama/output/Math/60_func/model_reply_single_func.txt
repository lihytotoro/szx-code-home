 The buggy function is:
```
public double cumulativeProbability(double x) throws MathException {
    final double dev = x - mean;
    try {
        return 0.5 * (1.0 + Erf.erf((dev) /
                (standardDeviation * FastMath.sqrt(2.0))));
    } catch (MaxIterationsExceededException ex) {
        if (x < (mean - 20 * standardDeviation)) { // JDK 1.5 blows at 38
            return 0;
        } else if (x > (mean + 20 * standardDeviation)) {
            return 1;
        } else {
            throw ex;
        }
    }
}
```
The bug is in the `catch` block, where the `MaxIterationsExceededException` is caught and not handled properly. The exception is thrown when the continued fraction algorithm used in the `Erf.erf()` method fails to converge, which can happen when the input value is too large.

The correct version of the function should handle the `MaxIterationsExceededException` and return a value that is consistent with the behavior of the `cumulativeProbability()` method. One way to do this is to return `1` when the input value is too large, as in the following code:
```
public double cumulativeProbability(double x) throws MathException {
    final double dev = x - mean;
    try {
        return 0.5 * (1.0 + Erf.erf((dev) /
                (standardDeviation * FastMath.sqrt(2.0))));
    } catch (MaxIterationsExceededException ex) {
        if (x < (mean - 20 * standardDeviation)) { // JDK 1.5 blows at 38
            return 0;
        } else if (x > (mean + 20 * standardDeviation)) {
            return 1;
        } else {
            throw ex;
        }
    }
}
```
Alternatively, the function could return a value that is consistent with the behavior of the `cumulativeProbability()` method when the input value is too large, such as `Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY`.
