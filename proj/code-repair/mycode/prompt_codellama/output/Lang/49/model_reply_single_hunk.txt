 The correct line at the INFILL location is:

int gcd = greatestCommonDivisor(Math.abs(numerator), denominator);

This line calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the absolute value of the numerator and the denominator, and stores it in the variable `gcd`. The buggy hunk was removed because it was causing the method to return the wrong result.
