 The bug in the code is in the line:
```
coefficients[i] = (basicRow == null ? 0 : getEntry(basicRow, getRhsOffset())) - (restrictToNonNegative ? 0 : mostNegative);
```
The correct version of the function should be:
```
coefficients[i] = (basicRow == null ? 0 : getEntry(basicRow, getRhsOffset())) - (restrictToNonNegative ? mostNegative : 0);
```
The bug is that the `mostNegative` variable is being used as the default value for the `coefficients` array, but it should be used as the default value for the `restrictToNonNegative` variable.

The corrected function should return the correct solution for the test case.
