 The correct line should be:

if (options.dependencyOptions.needsManagement() && options.closurePass && !options.processCommonJSModules) {

This is because the test is expecting the `goog.provide` and `goog.require` statements to be in the correct order, and the buggy hunk was causing them to be reversed. The correct hunk ensures that the `goog.provide` statement is always executed before the `goog.require` statement, regardless of the order in which they appear in the source code.
