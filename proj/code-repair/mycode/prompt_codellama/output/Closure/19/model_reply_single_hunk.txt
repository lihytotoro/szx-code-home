 The correct line at the INFILL location is:
```
scope.inferSlotType(node.getString(), type);
```
This line is inside the `case Token.NAME` block and is used to infer the type of a variable declaration. However, the `node.getString()` method returns the string "this" for a `Token.NAME` node, which is not a valid variable name. Therefore, the line throws an `IllegalArgumentException` with the message "Node cannot be refined."
