 The correct line at the INFILL location is:
```
return (_valueTypeDeserializer == null)
```
This line checks if the value type deserializer is null, which is a bug in the original code. The correct code should check if the value type deserializer is null or not, like this:
```
return (_valueTypeDeserializer == null || _ignorableProperties == null);
```
This code checks if either the value type deserializer or the ignorable properties is null, which is the correct logic to prevent caching.
