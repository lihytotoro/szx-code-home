 The buggy hunk was removed in the following line:

typeAdapter = typeAdapter.nullSafe();

The `nullSafe()` method is called on the `typeAdapter` object, but it is not guaranteed that the `typeAdapter` object is not null. Therefore, the code should check for null before calling `nullSafe()` to avoid a null pointer exception.

The corrected line should be:

typeAdapter = typeAdapter != null ? typeAdapter.nullSafe() : null;

This line checks if the `typeAdapter` object is null and returns null if it is. Otherwise, it calls the `nullSafe()` method on the `typeAdapter` object and returns the result.
