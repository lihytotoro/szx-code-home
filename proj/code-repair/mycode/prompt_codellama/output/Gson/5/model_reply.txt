 The correct line at the INFILL location is:

String timezoneOffset = date.substring(offset);

This line extracts the timezone offset from the input string, which is used to create a `TimeZone` object. However, the line is incorrect because it does not handle the case where the timezone offset is missing.

The correct line should be:

String timezoneOffset = date.substring(offset, offset + 5);

This line extracts the timezone offset from the input string, but it also specifies the length of the timezone offset, which is 5 characters. This ensures that the line handles the case where the timezone offset is missing.
