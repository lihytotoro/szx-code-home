 The correct line to insert at the INFILL location is:

return StringDescription.toString(m).equals(arg);

This fixes the bug by comparing the string representation of the matcher with the string representation of the argument, rather than calling the `toString()` method on the argument and comparing the result with the string representation of the matcher.
