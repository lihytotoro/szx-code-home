 The correct line at the INFILL location is:

    int g = (int) ((value - this.lowerBound) / (this.upperBound - this.lowerBound) * 255.0);

This line calculates the green value of the Color object based on the value parameter and the lower and upper bounds of the range. It first calculates the difference between the value and the lower bound, and then divides this difference by the difference between the upper and lower bounds to get a value between 0 and 1. This value is then multiplied by 255.0 to get a value between 0 and 255, which is the expected range for the green component of a Color object.
