 The bug in the code is in the line `int newLen = (len == MAX_SEGMENT_LEN) ? (MAX_SEGMENT_LEN+1) : Math.min(MAX_SEGMENT_LEN, len + (len >> 1));`.

The issue is that the code is using the bitwise right shift operator (`>>`) to divide the length of the current segment by 2, which is not the correct way to calculate the new length. Instead, the code should use the multiplication operator (`*`) to multiply the length of the current segment by a factor of 1.5, which is the correct way to calculate the new length.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```
public char[] expandCurrentSegment() {
    final char[] curr = _currentSegment;
    // Let's grow by 50% by default
    final int len = curr.length;
    // but above intended maximum, slow to increase by 25%
    int newLen = (len == MAX_SEGMENT_LEN) ? (MAX_SEGMENT_LEN+1) : Math.min(MAX_SEGMENT_LEN, len * 1.5);
    return (_currentSegment = Arrays.copyOf(curr, newLen));
}
```
