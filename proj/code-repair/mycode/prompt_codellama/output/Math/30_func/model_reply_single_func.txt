 The bug in the code is that the `VarU` variable is not being calculated correctly. The formula for the variance of the Mann-Whitney U statistic is:

VarU = n1n2prod \* (n1 + n2 + 1) / 12

However, the code is using the formula:

VarU = n1n2prod \* (n1 + n2) / 12

This is because the formula for the variance of the normal distribution is:

Var(X) = E(X^2) - E(X)^2

But in this case, `E(X)` is not being calculated correctly. The correct formula for `E(X)` is:

E(X) = (n1 + n2 + 1) / 2

So the correct formula for `VarU` is:

VarU = n1n2prod \* (n1 + n2 + 1) / 12

Here is the corrected code:
```
private double calculateAsymptoticPValue(final double Umin,
                                         final int n1,
                                         final int n2)
    throws ConvergenceException, MaxCountExceededException {

    final int n1n2prod = n1 * n2;

    // http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mann%E2%80%93Whitney_U#Normal_approximation
    final double EU = n1n2prod / 2.0;
    final double VarU = n1n2prod * (n1 + n2 + 1) / 12.0;

    final double z = (Umin - EU) / FastMath.sqrt(VarU);

    final NormalDistribution standardNormal = new NormalDistribution(0, 1);

    return 2 * standardNormal.cumulativeProbability(z);
}
```
