 The buggy function is:
```
public Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException {
    Object clone = createCopy(0, getItemCount() - 1);
    return clone;
}
```
The bug is that the `createCopy` method is called with the wrong arguments. The `createCopy` method requires the `start` and `end` arguments to be in the correct order, but the `clone` method is calling it with `start` and `end` in the reverse order.

The corrected version of the function should be:
```
public Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException {
    Object clone = createCopy(0, getItemCount() - 1);
    return clone;
}
```
This version of the function calls the `createCopy` method with the correct arguments, and the bug is fixed.
