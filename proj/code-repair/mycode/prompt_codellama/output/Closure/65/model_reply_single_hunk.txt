 The correct line at the INFILL location is:
```
case '\0': sb.append("\\0"); break;
```
This line was added to the switch statement to handle the case where the character is a null character (`\0`). The `appendHexJavaScriptRepresentation` method is used to append the hexadecimal representation of the null character to the `StringBuilder` object.
