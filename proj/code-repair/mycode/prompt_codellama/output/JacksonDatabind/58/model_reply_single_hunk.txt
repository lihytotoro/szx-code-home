 The correct line at the INFILL location is:
```
mutator.fixAccess(ctxt.isEnabled(MapperFeature.OVERRIDE_PUBLIC_ACCESS_MODIFIERS));
```
This line is attempting to access the `cause` field of a `Throwable` object, which is a private field. The `fixAccess` method is attempting to force access to this field, but it is not allowed to do so. The `MapperFeature.OVERRIDE_PUBLIC_ACCESS_MODIFIERS` feature is used to enable or disable this behavior.
