 The correct line at the INFILL location should be:

{
    buff.append(" <").append(option.getArgName()).append(">");
}

This is because the `Option` class has a `getArgName()` method that returns the argument name for the option, and the `hasArg()` method that indicates whether the option has an argument. The `appendOption()` method is using these methods to determine whether to append the argument name to the usage string.

The original buggy line was removed because it was not necessary, and it was causing the test to fail. The corrected line is more concise and easier to read.
