 The correct line at the INFILL location is:
```
pathNames[stackSize - 2] = "null";
```
This line is trying to access the `pathNames` array with an index of `-2`, which is an invalid index. The correct fix is to change the line to:
```
pathNames[stackSize - 1] = "null";
```
This will access the `pathNames` array with a valid index, and fix the bug.
