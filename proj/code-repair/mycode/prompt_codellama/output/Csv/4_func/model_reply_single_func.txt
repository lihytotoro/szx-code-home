 The buggy function is:
```
public Map<String, Integer> getHeaderMap() {
    return new LinkedHashMap<String, Integer>(this.headerMap);
}
```
The bug is that `this.headerMap` is not initialized, so it is null. Therefore, the function is returning a null map, which is causing the `NullPointerException` when the test tries to access it.

The corrected function should initialize the `headerMap` field before returning it:
```
public Map<String, Integer> getHeaderMap() {
    if (this.headerMap == null) {
        this.headerMap = new LinkedHashMap<String, Integer>();
    }
    return new LinkedHashMap<String, Integer>(this.headerMap);
}
```
This ensures that the `headerMap` field is always initialized before it is returned, and the function no longer throws a `NullPointerException`.
