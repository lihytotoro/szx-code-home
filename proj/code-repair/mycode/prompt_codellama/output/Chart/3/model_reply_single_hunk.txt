 The correct line at the INFILL location is:
```
copy.data = new java.util.ArrayList();
```
This line creates a new empty list for the `copy` object, which is then used to store the cloned data items. The buggy hunk was removed by replacing this line with the following code:
```
copy.data = new java.util.ArrayList(this.data.subList(start, end));
```
This code creates a new list based on the sublist of the original data, starting from the `start` index and ending at the `end` index. This fixes the bug by ensuring that the correct data is copied to the `copy` object.
