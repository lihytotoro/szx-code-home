 The buggy function is:
```
public Element clone() {
    Element clone = (Element) super.clone();
    clone.classNames();
    return clone;
}
```
The bug is that the `classNames()` method is being called on the cloned element, which is not what we want. We want to clone the element and preserve its original class names, not modify them.

The corrected function should be:
```
public Element clone() {
    Element clone = (Element) super.clone();
    clone.classNames = new HashSet<>(classNames);
    return clone;
}
```
This function creates a new `HashSet` object for the `classNames` field of the cloned element, and initializes it with the original class names. This ensures that the cloned element has the same class names as the original element.
