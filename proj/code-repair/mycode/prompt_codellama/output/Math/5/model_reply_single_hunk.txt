 The correct line at the INFILL location should be:
```
return Complex.ZERO;
```
This is because the method is supposed to return the reciprocal of the complex number, which is `Complex.ZERO` when the real and imaginary parts are both zero. The original buggy line `return NaN;` was removed, and the correct line was inserted at the INFILL location.
