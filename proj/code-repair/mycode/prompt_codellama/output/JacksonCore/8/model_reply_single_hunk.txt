 The correct line at the INFILL location is:
```
if (_resultString != null) {
    return (_resultArray = _resultString.toCharArray());
}
```
This line is responsible for creating a new array from the `resultString` if it is not null. The buggy hunk was removed because it was not necessary and it was causing the `NullPointerException` error.
