 The correct line at the INFILL location should be:
```
boolean isOverride = parent.getType() == Token.ASSIGN && parent.getFirstChild() == getprop;
```
This line checks if the current node is an ASSIGN statement and if the left-hand side of the assignment is the same as the GETPROP node. This is the correct condition to check for overriding a private property.
