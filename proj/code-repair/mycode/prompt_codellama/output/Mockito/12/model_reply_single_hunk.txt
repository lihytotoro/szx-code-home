 The correct line at the INFILL location should be:
```
return (Class<?>) actual;
```
This is because the `getActualTypeArguments()` method returns an array of `Type` objects, and we need to cast the first element of this array to a `Class` object. The `<?>` wildcard is used to indicate that the type of the `Class` object is unknown, since it is a generic type.
