 The correct line at the INFILL location is:
```
matchRecordTypeConstraint(constraint.toObjectType());
```
This line calls the `matchRecordTypeConstraint` method with the `constraint.toObjectType()` object as an argument. The `matchRecordTypeConstraint` method is responsible for modifying the object literal to match the constraint, by taking any each property on the record and trying to match properties on this object.

The bug in the original code was that the `matchRecordTypeConstraint` method was not being called with the correct argument. The `constraint.toObjectType()` method returns the object type of the record, which is not the correct type to pass to the `matchRecordTypeConstraint` method. The correct type to pass is the `constraint` object itself, which is a record type.

Therefore, the corrected line at the INFILL location should be:
```
matchRecordTypeConstraint(constraint);
```
