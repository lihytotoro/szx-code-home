 The correct line at the INFILL location is:
```
_hashArea = Arrays.copyOf(_hashArea, _hashArea.length);
```
This line is used to copy the contents of the `_hashArea` array to a new array with the same length. The buggy hunk was removed because it was causing the `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` error.
