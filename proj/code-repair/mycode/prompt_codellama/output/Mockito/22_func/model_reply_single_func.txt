 The bug in the code is that it does not handle the case where both `o1` and `o2` are arrays, but the arrays are not of the same type.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```
public static boolean areEqual(Object o1, Object o2) {
    if (o1 == null || o2 == null) {
        return o1 == null && o2 == null;
    } else if (isArray(o1) && isArray(o2)) {
        return areArraysEqual(o1, o2);
    } else {
        return o1.equals(o2);
    }
}
```
This version checks if both `o1` and `o2` are arrays, and if so, it calls the `areArraysEqual` function to compare them. If either `o1` or `o2` is not an array, it falls back to the `equals` method.

With this correction, the test should pass.
