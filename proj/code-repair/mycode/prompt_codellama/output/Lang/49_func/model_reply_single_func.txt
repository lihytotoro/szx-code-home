 The buggy function is:
```
public Fraction reduce() {
    int gcd = greatestCommonDivisor(Math.abs(numerator), denominator);
    if (gcd == 1) {
        return this;
    }
    return Fraction.getFraction(numerator / gcd, denominator / gcd);
}
```
The bug is in the line `return Fraction.getFraction(numerator / gcd, denominator / gcd);`. The function is returning a new `Fraction` object with the numerator and denominator reduced, but it is not updating the `this` object. Therefore, the `this` object is still holding the original numerator and denominator, and the test is failing.

The corrected version of the function should be:
```
public Fraction reduce() {
    int gcd = greatestCommonDivisor(Math.abs(numerator), denominator);
    if (gcd == 1) {
        return this;
    }
    numerator /= gcd;
    denominator /= gcd;
    return this;
}
```
This version of the function updates the `this` object with the reduced numerator and denominator, and returns the updated `this` object.
