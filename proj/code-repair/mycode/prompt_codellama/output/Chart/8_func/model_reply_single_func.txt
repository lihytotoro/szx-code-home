 The buggy function is:
```
public Week(Date time, TimeZone zone) {
    // defer argument checking...
    this(time, RegularTimePeriod.DEFAULT_TIME_ZONE, Locale.getDefault());
}
```
The bug is that the `this` constructor is not being called with the correct arguments. The `this` constructor is defined as:
```
public Week(Date time, TimeZone zone, Locale locale) {
    // ...
}
```
So, when the `this` constructor is called with the arguments `time`, `RegularTimePeriod.DEFAULT_TIME_ZONE`, and `Locale.getDefault()`, it is not using the correct `locale` argument.

To fix the bug, we need to pass the correct `locale` argument to the `this` constructor. Here is the corrected version of the function:
```
public Week(Date time, TimeZone zone) {
    this(time, zone, Locale.getDefault());
}
```
This version of the function correctly passes the correct `locale` argument to the `this` constructor, and the bug is fixed.
