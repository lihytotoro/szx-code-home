 The bug in the code is that it is using the `equals()` method to compare two `Method` objects, which is not the correct way to do it. The `equals()` method is not defined for `Method` objects, and it is not guaranteed to return `true` even if the two methods are the same.

The correct way to compare two `Method` objects is to use the `equals()` method of the `Method` class, which is defined as follows:
```
public boolean equals(Object obj) {
    if (obj == this) {
        return true;
    }
    if (!(obj instanceof Method)) {
        return false;
    }
    Method other = (Method) obj;
    return other.getName().equals(getName()) &&
           other.getParameterTypes().equals(getParameterTypes()) &&
           other.getReturnType().equals(getReturnType());
}
```
This method compares the name, parameter types, and return type of the two methods, and returns `true` if they are all the same.

Therefore, the corrected version of the `hasSameMethod()` method would be:
```
public boolean hasSameMethod(Invocation candidate) {
    Method m1 = invocation.getMethod();
    Method m2 = candidate.getMethod();
    return m1.equals(m2);
}
```
This method uses the `equals()` method of the `Method` class to compare the two methods, and returns `true` if they are the same.
