 The correct line at the INFILL location is:
```
if (ext.handlePropertyValue(p, ctxt, propName, null)) {
```
This line is incorrect because it passes `buffer` as the last argument to `ext.handlePropertyValue()`, which is not correct. Instead, it should pass `null` as the last argument, as shown in the corrected line.
