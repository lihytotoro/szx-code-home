 The bug is in the following line:
```
if (NodeUtil.mayEffectMutableState(cArg, compiler)
    && NodeUtil.getNameReferenceCount(
        block, fnParam.getString()) > 1) {
```
The `NodeUtil.mayEffectMutableState` method checks if a node may have side effects, but it does not take into account the context of the node. In this case, the `cArg` node is a parameter reference, and it may have side effects if the function it is passed to modifies the state of the object. However, the `NodeUtil.mayEffectMutableState` method does not take into account the fact that the parameter reference is being passed to a function, and it may return `true` even if the function does not modify the state of the object.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `NodeUtil.mayEffectMutableState` method to take into account the context of the node. One way to do this is to check if the node is a parameter reference, and if so, check if the function it is passed to modifies the state of the object. Here is an example of how this could be implemented:
```
if (NodeUtil.mayEffectMutableState(cArg, compiler)
    && (cArg.isParameterReference() && NodeUtil.mayEffectMutableState(
        NodeUtil.getFunction(cArg), compiler))) {
```
This code checks if the node is a parameter reference, and if so, it checks if the function it is passed to modifies the state of the object. If either of these conditions is true, the method returns `true`.

With this modification, the buggy function should be corrected and the test should pass.
