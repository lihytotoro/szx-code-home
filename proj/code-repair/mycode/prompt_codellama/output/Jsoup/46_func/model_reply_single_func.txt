 The bug is in the `canEncode` method, which is used to check if a character can be encoded by the encoder. The method is implemented as follows:
```
private static boolean canEncode(CoreCharset coreCharset, char c, CharsetEncoder encoder) {
    return encoder.canEncode(c);
}
```
The problem is that the `canEncode` method is not checking the character's code point, but rather its UTF-16 representation. This means that characters outside of the BMP (i.e. those with code points above 0xFFFF) will not be properly encoded.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canEncode` method to check the character's code point instead of its UTF-16 representation. Here's the corrected version:
```
private static boolean canEncode(CoreCharset coreCharset, char c, CharsetEncoder encoder) {
    return encoder.canEncode(Character.toCodePoint(c));
}
```
With this fix, the `canEncode` method will properly check the character's code point, and the bug should be resolved.
