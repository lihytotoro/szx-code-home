 The bug in the code is that it does not handle the case where the input string has multiple quotes at the beginning or end. For example, if the input string is "foo \"bar\" \"baz\"", the function will strip the leading and trailing quotes, resulting in "foo "bar" "baz"", which is not the expected output.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```
static String stripLeadingAndTrailingQuotes(String str) {
    while (str.startsWith("\"")) {
        str = str.substring(1, str.length());
    }
    while (str.endsWith("\"")) {
        str = str.substring(0, str.length() - 1);
    }
    return str;
}
```
This version of the function uses a while loop to strip the leading and trailing quotes, rather than an if statement. This ensures that all leading and trailing quotes are stripped, regardless of the number of quotes present.
