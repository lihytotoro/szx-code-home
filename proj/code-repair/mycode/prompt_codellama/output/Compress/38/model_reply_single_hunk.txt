 The correct line at the INFILL location is:

    if (getName().endsWith("/")) {

This line is checking if the name of the entry ends with a forward slash, which is a common convention used in tar archives to indicate that the entry is a directory. The buggy hunk was checking if the entry was a directory by checking if the link flag was set to `LF_DIR`, but this check was not correct. The correct check is to check if the name ends with a forward slash, as this is the standard convention used in tar archives.
