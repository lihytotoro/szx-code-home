 The correct line at the INFILL location is:
```
if (DateTimeUtils.isContiguous(partial)) {
```
This line checks if the partial object is contiguous, which means that it has a continuous range of values for each field. If the partial object is not contiguous, the code will fall back to the superclass algorithm, which may not handle the 2004-02-29 + 48 months -> 2008-02-29 type dates correctly.
