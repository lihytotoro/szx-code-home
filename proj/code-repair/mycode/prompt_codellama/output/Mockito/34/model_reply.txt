 The correct line at the INFILL location should be:

    for (Matcher m : matchers) {
        ((CapturesArguments) m).captureFrom(i.getArguments()[k]);
    }

This line captures the arguments from the invocation using the `CapturesArguments` matcher, which is an interface that extends `Matcher`. The `captureFrom` method is called on each matcher in the list, passing in the argument at the current index `k`. The `k` variable is incremented after each iteration of the loop.
